The state-owned refiner posted a net profit of 62.04 billion rupees ($750.8 million) for the quarter ended June 30, its highest since March 2013, from a loss of 101.97 billion rupees a year ago. It also beat analysts' estimate of 49.59 billion rupees as per Refinitiv IBES data. Refining companies, including HPCL, benefitted from an average 30.6% fall in oil prices from a year ago in the quarter. Indian fuel retailers sold fuel at a loss last year as oil prices surged and supply chains were hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The companies recovered some of those losses in the quarter on higher marketing margins, analysts said. HPCL's input costs declined 12.5%, and total expenses fell 17.8% to 1.11 trillion rupees. Sale of products was slightly down to 1.19 trillion rupees, much like its peers Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) and Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL.NS). However, the company posted highest-ever quarterly domestic sales volume of 11.43 million metric tonnes (MMT). The company's marketing arm also registered its highest-ever quarterly sales of 11.85 MMT, a 10.7% growth. The company said its average gross refining margin - profit from making refined products from one barrel of oil - was $7.44 per barrel for the quarter, compared to $16.69 per barrel a year ago. Last week, other state-owned refiners Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum also posted profits on higher marketing margins. Shares of HPCL closed 3% down ahead of the results.

Brent crude futures for October slipped 36 cents, or 0.4%, to $84.55 a barrel by 1354 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September fell 38 cents, or 0.5%, to $80.99 a barrel. Both contracts rose by more than $1 earlier on the session, buoyed by falling U.S. stockpiles. U.S. crude inventories fell by 15.4 million barrels in the week ended July 28, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures, compared with analysts' estimates for a drop of 1.37 million barrels. If the U.S. government figures, due later on Wednesday, match the API drawdown number, it would mark the largest drop in U.S. crude inventories according to records dating back to 1982. Gasoline inventories fell by 1.7 million barrels, the API data showed, compared with estimates for a 1.3 million barrel drop. Distillate stocks fell by 510,000 barrels, compared with analysts estimates for a build of 112,000 barrels. Both are indicators of robust prompt fuel demand in the U.S. ""For most of the last two weeks it has been to products that oil has looked for its forward leanings, but the overnight remarkable draws in the API data sees crude take over the bull baton and give the market another spurring on,"" PVM Oil analysts said. Crude oil inventories have also begun to drop in other regions as demand outpaces supply, which has been constrained by deep production cuts from Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Concerns have risen that oil buying in China, the world's biggest oil importer, may slow as prices rise. Weak PMI data released this week, meanwhile, indicated fuel demand may be weaker than expected. ""Chinese crude buying has been opportunistic rather than due to higher demand. (The) market continues to be driven purely by supply constraints, which are always subject to potential political volatility,"" said Sparta Commodities' Philip Jones-Lux. Analysts expect Saudi Arabia to extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include September in a meeting of producers on Friday.

crude oil,"Stocks drop, Treasury yields rise after Fitch downgrades US","August 2, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2023-08-02/,"Aug 2 (Reuters) - Global shares fell while Treasury yields and the dollar advanced on Wednesday as investors digested an unexpected downgrade of the United States' top-tier sovereign credit rating and private payrolls data that pointed to US labor market resilience. Fitch, after the Wall Street close on Tuesday, cut the U.S. by one notch to AA+ from AAA, citing fiscal deterioration. Investors showed little sign of panic. ""Look, no-one is seriously considering the prospect that the U.S. would ever fail to make a payment on its debt,"" said Eric Winograd, chief economist at AllianceBernstein in New York. ""There will continue to be demand for both long-term and short-term Treasuries, and I don’t see this downgrade as a significant signal of any trouble ahead."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 0.48%, to 35,458.74, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.78%, to 4,540.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 1.08%, to 14,129.91. The downgrade hit global stock markets, taking Europe's STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) down 1.2% to a two-week low. Asia-Pacific stocks dropped earlier, down about 2%, partly because of signs of weakness in China's economy. (.MIAP00000PUS) U.S. 10-year Treasury yields , after an initial dip, rose 3 basis points to 4.078%, while credit default swaps, which insure exposure to U.S. Treasuries, were little moved, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The U.S. dollar was up 0.44% against a basket of peers. . The CBOE Market Volatility Index (.VIX) jumped 10% on Wednesday but was still near the lows of the last 12 months. ""The lack of movement in U.S. Treasury Bonds and the dollar index suggests the market has already largely quantified and assessed the damage done from recent fallouts,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Fitch's move, which came after it had placed the ratings on negative watch in May, drew an angry response from the White House, which called it ""arbitrary and based on outdated data"" as it came two months after a debt ceiling agreement that averted a U.S. default. Investors drew comparisons with what happened when Standard & Poor's cut the U.S.'s AAA rating in 2011 after the global financial crisis. Investors then also took refuge from riskier equities by piling into Treasuries, but the rally in bonds was much larger than so far this time. ""S&P being the first to downgrade 12 years ago was far bigger news and has allowed investors to adjust for the most important bond market in the world not being a pure AAA anymore, but it's still a big decision,"" said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid. While investors say the downgrade is unlikely to have a big impact on U.S. Treasuries, which underpin the financial system as an unrivalled global safe asset, it has injected some uncertainty into financial markets and cast renewed attention on the debt metrics of the world's largest economy. The news also came just after the U.S. Treasury said on Monday it expected to borrow $1.007 trillion in the third quarter, the largest amount yet for that period, compared with May's $274 billion estimate. Tony Sycamore, an analyst with IG, said that apart from the Fitch move, there had been some disappointing data in the U.S. and China and some weaker than expected earnings, so people were taking money off the table. Elsewhere, Japan's 10-year bond yield hit a nine-year peak on Wednesday as investors continued to test the Bank of Japan's tolerance for higher yields following Friday's surprise policy tweak. The yen was little changed against the dollar, looking to reverse three sessions of losses. Attention was still firmly on monetary policy, with uncertainty around how much the Bank of England will increase rates on Thursday. The decision is essentially seen as a coin toss with investors betting on a roughly 60% chance of a 25 basis-point move after an unexpectedly large 50 basis-point increase in June. Economic data was also in focus, with the U.S. due to publish jobs market data this week. Oil prices were steady on Wednesday at close to their highest levels since April, buoyed by crude and fuel product inventory data that showed robust U.S. demand.

The company's shares fell 1.2% to $110.80 in premarket trade.

crude oil,Morning Bid: Triple-A headache,"August 2, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-view-usa-2023-08-02/,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Amanda Cooper. Two out of three ain't so good. On Tuesday, Fitch became the second major agency, after Standard & Poor's in 2011, to strip the United States of its prized triple-A credit rating. Fitch cut by a notch to AA+ and cited fiscal deterioration over the next year and repeated down-to-the-wire negotiations on Capitol Hill over the country's debt ceiling. Two months ago, lawmakers were haggling over the government borrowing limit and the two sides seemed so far apart that the process threatened to tip the world's largest economy into a technical default. The event itself has not come as a shock, given Fitch warned back in June, after the crisis was resolved, that it would finalise that view later in the year. But the timing has caught a few in the market by surprise. Investors have responded by knocking equities and scooping up government bonds, which has pushed the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note down towards 4.0%, while the dollar is looking fragile. For now, investors agree that the downgrade is unlikely to do much to shift international demand for Treasuries or for U.S. stocks, which explains the very muted market reaction. But it's a dent to the country's reputation and puts the health of U.S. public finances in the spotlight, a factor a number of market watchers expect to act as a negative driver of the dollar over the longer term. A May report by Moody's Analytics - a unit of rating agency Moody's Investors Service, which still has an ""Aaa"" rating for the U.S. government - said a downgrade of Treasury debt would set off a cascade of credit implications and downgrades on the debt of many other institutions. There have been warnings from rating agencies, economists, politicians and strategists that the U.S. government spending relative to tax collections isn't sustainable. Fitch says it expects the U.S. general government deficit to rise to 6.3% of GDP this year, from 3.7% in 2022. Jefferies notes that, with two of the three major agencies listing U.S. debt at AA, U.S. bonds no longer count as AAA in some key indices. However, according to Jefferies, most investors have moved away from some of the stricter criteria around holding triple-A rated debt, given Germany is the only large issuer left with that rating. But either way, with a presidential election just over a year away, it's not a good look. Key developments that could provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: * U.S. corp earnings: Dupont Nemours, Exelon, CVS Health, Entergy, Kraft Heinz, Garmin, Yum! Brands, Phillips 66, Bunge Ltd, Lincoln National, Albemarle, Occidental Petroleum, ETSY, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Atmos Energy, Equinix, Qualcomm, MGM Resorts, Ingersoll Rand, MetLife, Clorox, Marathon Oil * U.S. ADP July private sector payrolls, EIA weekly crude stocks.",2023-08-02 20:43:54.139685,"
Fitch downgraded U.S. debt to AA+, citing fiscal deterioration and repeated debt ceiling negotiations. The move is unlikely to have a significant impact on the dollar or Treasuries in the short term, but it could put pressure on the U.S. government's borrowing costs over the longer term.","[Fitch, downgrade, U.S., debt, deficit]"

At its last policy meeting in June, OPEC+ agreed on a broad deal to limit supply into 2024 and Saudi Arabia pledged a voluntary production cut for July that it has since extended to include August. Analysts told Reuters last week they expected Saudi Arabia to extend the voluntary cut for another month to include September.

U.S. shale producers have been forced to reduce the number of rigs in operation and delay well completions as profits have fallen from bumper 2022 levels after crude prices eased from multi-year highs. Pioneer, a top producer in the Permian shale basin, cut its 2023 budget, including for drilling and completions, by $125 million to a range of $4.375 billion to $4.575 billion. The company said it now plans to operate an average of 23 to 25 horizontal drilling rigs in Permian's Midland basin for the year, down by one from the midpoint of its prior forecast. It also expects to place 490 to 520 wells on production, below the 500 to 530 forecast in April. Devon, which operates in Permian's Delaware basin, forecast capital spending of about $900 million in the third quarter, less than in the second quarter, after one temporary fracking crew was dropped from the basin. Top oilfield service companies have flagged weakening North American oilfield activity in the second half of the year, though recent strength in oil prices have led some companies to forecast a recovery in drilling and fracking later this year. Devon maintained its full-year production forecast of 643,000 to 663,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while Pioneer raised its output estimate by 3% at its midpoint to a range of 697,000 to 717,000 boepd. Pioneer's second-quarter profit more than halved to $4.49 but beat analysts' consensus estimate of $4.18, sending its shares 1.2% higher to $227.90 in extended trading. Devon's adjusted income fell over 50% to $1.18, in line with analysts' estimates. The company's shares fell 2.2% to $52.50.",2023-08-02 20:43:54.139685,"

Analysts had expected a drop of 1.37 million barrels. Gasoline inventories fell by about 1.7 million barrels, compared with estimates for a 1.3 million-barrel drop. Distillate inventories fell by about 510,000 barrels, compared with analysts estimates for a build of 112,000 barrels. The inventory data helped crude futures tick up in post settlement trade.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.2%, to 35,630.55, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.27%, to 4,576.72 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 0.43%, to 14,283.91.

European stocks (.STOXX) fell 0.9%, stepping back from a 2% increase in July, the index's second month of gains. UK stocks (.FTSE) also fell 0.4%, though HSBC (HSBA.L) climbed 1.3% after announcing a $2 billion share buyback and raising its key profitability target. Losses accelerated across European markets after data showed manufacturing activity in the bloc contracted in July at the fastest pace since May 2020 amid slumping demand even as factories cut their prices sharply. The data disappointed investors who are readying for an end to a series of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, with an increase last week widely seen as one of the last in its current tightening cycle. Market players put Tuesday's losses down to a combination of profit taking at the start of the month, as well as nerves over the health of the global economy. ""The economy is a little bit weaker than perhaps people would like, and I think that's a concern for earnings growth heading into the second half of the year,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday with 30-year paper touching a new year-high as investors expected an increase in government debt issuance and anticipated more signs of economic resilience, despite data showing a slowdown in activity. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 7.2 basis points at 4.029%. The two-year yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 2.5 basis points at 4.900%.

The U.S. dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, rose 0.35%. The greenback also hit a three-week high against the yen as investors continued to seek clarity on the Bank of Japan's recent adjustment to its yield curve control and what that might mean for monetary policy.

crude oil,Republicans struggle to diverge from Bidenomics,"August 1, 2023",https://reuters.com/breakingviews/republicans-struggle-diverge-bidenomics-2023-08-01/,"WASHINGTON, Aug 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Republicans with ambitions to move into the White House have a love-hate relationship with Bidenomics. Former occupant Donald Trump has called President Joe Biden’s economic record a “disaster,” while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently emphasized an “economic malaise” under the sitting U.S. commander-in-chief. At the same time, both challengers are echoing some of the incumbent’s most ambitious efforts. DeSantis on Monday unveiled an economic plan, one of the first candidates to do so ahead of the November 2024 election. He laid out a 10-point “Declaration of Economic Independence,” which includes achieving 3% GDP growth, compared to the 2.4% pace in the second quarter, and “reining in” the Federal Reserve, whose interest rate hikes have arguably helped reduce inflation. The list also includes a vague call to reverse the president’s “job-crippling” executive orders and end all support for socially conscious investing. More than 13 million jobs have been added since Biden took office while the unemployment rate stood at a low 3.6% as of June. Both the DeSantis and Trump campaigns also have touted American “energy independence” as part of their agendas, yet the approaches will likely mirror Biden’s. Fossil-fuel usage has held steady since the 45th president was elected, despite his push for renewables. Crude oil and natural gas account for two-thirds of U.S. energy creation, and crude production has climbed since 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration. Yet oil and gas are inherently limited, and their prices are vulnerable to global shocks such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Building a more resilient energy supply therefore relies on solar, wind and other sources, and Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act devotes nearly $400 billion to such projects. A continued push for true “energy independence” probably would look more like Biden’s strategy than anything else. So too would any positions on Beijing and manufacturing. DeSantis calls for “taking back control” of the economy from China, while Trump has said his trade policies will end Chinese imports of essential goods. Both sound a lot like “de-risking,” the Biden administration term for its industrial policy. The CHIPS Act the president signed last August includes $77 billion to support a domestic semiconductor industry. Republican proposals are more aggressive, but replacing Chinese production will almost surely require a similar framework as Biden’s. There may be Republican rhetoric that appeals to voters, but much of Bidenomics will probably be around for a while. Follow @BenWinck on X  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.  The opinions expressed are his own.) CONTEXT NEWS Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on July 31 unveiled a platform he branded a “Declaration of Economic Independence” as part of his presidential campaign during a speech in New Hampshire. The agenda includes 10 core tenets, including greater independence from China, energy independence and promoting domestic investment.

Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $1.53 billion in the period, a 5% increase from the same time a year ago and a new quarterly record, the company said. Adjusted EBITDA in MPLX's logistics and storage segment rose to $1.02 billion, compared with $966 million for the second quarter of 2022. The company's average tariff rate was $0.89 per barrel, 9% higher than from the same time last year. Total pipeline throughputs were 6 million barrels per day (bpd), an increase of 1% versus the same quarter of 2022, while terminal throughput was 3.2 million bpd, an increase of 3%. Crude pipeline volumes were up 4%, a new quarterly record, as the company grew throughputs through expansion and debottlenecking activities, John Quaid, the company's chief financial officer told an earnings conference call on Tuesday. Product pipeline volumes were down 6% year-on-year as last year's market dynamics were more favorable. Refinery turnarounds also reduced the amount. Adjusted EBITDA in MPLX's gathering and processing segment rose to $509 million, compared with $491 million for the second quarter of 2022. Higher volumes and throughput fees offset lower natural gas liquids prices, it said. Natural gas liquids prices averaged $0.63 per gallon, compared with $1.18 in the second quarter of 2022, resulting in a roughly $50 million headwind for the results, Quaid said. Gathered volumes averaged 6.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d), a 9% increase from the second quarter of 2022. MPLX is expanding its natural gas and natural gas liquids long-haul and crude gathering pipelines supporting the Permian and Bakken basins. In the Permian, it is expanding its Whistler pipeline from 2.0 bcf/d to 2.5 bcf/d, and the Agua Dulce Corpus Christi (ADCC) Pipeline lateral. It expects to complete the expansion of the BANGL joint venture pipeline to 200,000 bpd in the first half of 2025. MPLX could consider additional expansions of the pipeline if market dynamics remain strong in the Permian Basin, the company told the conference call. In the Permian's Delaware basin, MPLX expects its sixth natural gas processing plant, Preakness ll, to come online in the first half of 2024, with the same timeline for its Harmon Creek ll facility in the Marcellus.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the second quarter of 2023 were $2.17 billion, versus $2.36 billion a year before. Lower revenues on the company's EFS Midstream System, as well as lower volumes on its propylene and octane enhancement business, also affected earnings, it said. That was partially offset by higher revenues from increased volumes on its natural gas liquids, natural gas and crude oil businesses, it said.

Hedge funds and other money managers purchased the equivalent of 52 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts over the seven days ending on July 25. Fund managers had purchased a total of 229 million barrels over the four weeks since June 27, according to reports filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and ICE Futures Europe. Most of the buying was in contracts linked to crude oil (+169 million barrels) with a particular emphasis on NYMEX and ICE WTI (+132 million). Saudi Arabia’s output cut coupled with increased optimism about the prospects for an economic soft landing in the United States lifted some of the pessimism that had depressed WTI positions. Bearish short positions were cut by 104 million barrels while bullish long positions increased by 65 million across the NYMEX and ICE WTI contracts. Short-covering has helped lift front-month WTI futures prices to over $81 per barrel on Aug. 1 from less than $68 on June 27. Across WTI and Brent, the combined position increased to 374 million barrels (24th percentile for all weeks since 2013) on July 25, up from a record low of just 205 million barrels on June 27. Chartbook: Oil and gas positions Over the same four weeks, position-building was also evident in contracts tied to the price of refined fuels (+60 million barrels) with a particular focus on middle distillates (+37 million). Fund managers have become increasingly optimistic about fuel prices given that inventories remain well below normal despite the industrial recession in North America, Europe and China over the last 6-9 months. In the event of a soft-landing and subsequent return to expansion, increasing fuel consumption could tighten already-depleted fuel supplies quickly. European gas oil futures and options have experienced an especially rapid increase in positions over the last four weeks (+29 million barrels). As a result, the net position rose to 41 million barrels (44th percentile) on July 25 from just 12 million barrels (18th percentile) on June 27. Europe’s industrial economy is currently experiencing its worst slowdown since the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and before that the recession associated with the financial crisis in 2008/09. But inventories are well below the long-term seasonal average and supplies will tighten rapidly if the U.S. economy expands again soon after a soft landing. Portfolio investors are trying to become bullish about U.S. natural gas despite inventories remaining stubbornly above the long-term average and only slight signs of the surplus eroding. Hedge funds and other money managers purchased futures and options equivalent to 176 billion cubic feet over the seven days ending on July 25. The net position increased to 723 billion cubic feet (47th percentile for all weeks since 2010) from a net short of 1,061 billion cubic feet (7th percentile) on Jan. 31. Working gas inventories in underground storage were still +248 billion cubic feet (+9% or +0.72 standard deviations) above the prior 10-year seasonal average on July 21. But the surplus has narrowed from +299 billion cubic feet (+12% or +0.81 standard deviations) on June 30, which suggests the production-consumption balance may be moving into a small deficit. The number of rigs drilling for oil and gas fell by more than 100 (-14%) in July 2023 compared with the recent cyclical peak in December 2022. Slower drilling is likely to translate into less production of gas-well and associated gas from the third quarter of 2023 through until at least the first quarter of 2024, which could quickly erode surplus inventories. From a positioning and fundamental perspective the balance of price risks is tilted to the upside, encouraging investors to start rebuilding a bullish position, albeit cautiously.

The country's Consumer Price Index rose to 28.3% in July, year-on-year, the statistics bureau said in a statement on Tuesday, with prices up 3.5% in July from the previous month. In June, the CPI rise was 29.4% year-on-year, coming off a record 38% in May. In a recorded video statement, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said gasoline, or petrol, prices would be raised by 19.95 Pakistani rupees to 272.95 Pakistani rupees ($0.952) per litre and diesel by 19.90 rupees to 273.40 rupees per litre, an increase of 7.8% for both fuels. Fuel prices have increased sharply in global markets in the last 15 days, Dar said, adding his government had tried to minimise the hike. Benchmark Brent crude oil prices climbed 16% during July. He said the country was not in a position to deviate from the IMF's standby agreement, finalised on June 30 after eight months of negotiations over tough fiscal discipline measures. ""You all know the international commitments we have with the IMF regarding the petroleum levy,"" he said, adding the increase could have been smaller without the pledges. Islamabad has committed to a petroleum levy of up to 50 rupees a litre, alongside a string of painful measures, including raising extra revenues, increasing energy prices and a market-based exchange rate, which has already fuelled inflation. Dar did not say what the levy was in his statement on Tuesday, but last month he said the government would try to keep it at about 45 rupees a litre. The IMF has also called on Pakistan to maintain a tight monetary policy. The central bank on Monday, however, kept the policy rate steady at 22%, with its governor saying the lender's requirement for tight policy didn't necessarily mean raising the rate. ""We doubt this marks the end of the tightening cycle,"" said Captial Economics, a global analysis group, in a statement issued Monday. ""With inflation likely to remain above target for some considerable time and the upside risks to prices building, we expect further rate hikes later this year,"" it added. The petroleum price increases and the sky-rocketing inflation will have political implications for Dar's coalition government just months before a general election where it will see former prime minister Imran Khan's party as the main opponent.

Bunge forecast full-year adjusted profit to be at least $11.75 per share on an improving margin outlook, up from guidance of $11 a share previously and above the average analyst estimate of $11.60 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Bunge shares were up 6% at midmorning at $114.96, a 14-month high. The earnings beat comes as Bunge is working to close a merger deal with crop handler Viterra that would create a global agribusiness powerhouse worth about $34 billion with annual earnings projected around $4 billion. Global grains merchants have capitalized on robust demand for food, animal feed and biofuel. They further profited from higher crop prices due to a string of supply chain disruptions, from the COVID-19 pandemic to an historic Argentine drought to a war in major grains exporter Ukraine. But profits for Bunge and grain trading rivals such as Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM.N), Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, have moderated from record levels last year due to rising operating costs and tighter oilseed processing margins, which have now started to rebound. ADM reported a drop in second-quarter profit last month but raised its full-year guidance, citing improving market conditions in the second half of the year. Bunge said second-quarter adjusted earnings in Agribusiness, its largest segment in terms of sales and volumes, jumped 75% as a record-large Brazilian soybean crop boosted its processing operations. The surge in processing profit more than offset mixed results from Bunge's Refined & Specialty Oils unit and lower profit from its Milling segment. Bunge's adjusted profit was $3.72 per share for the three months ended June 30, compared with analysts' estimate of $2.69 per share.",2023-08-02 20:43:54.139685,"

biofuel,Biden administration split over ethanol's role in aviation fuel subsidy program,"August 2, 2023",https://reuters.com/sustainability/biden-administration-split-over-ethanols-role-aviation-fuel-subsidy-program-2023-08-02/,"Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is divided over whether to grant a request from the U.S. biofuel industry that would make it easier for sustainable aviation fuel made from corn-based ethanol to qualify for subsidies under the White House's signature climate law, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. The indecision has touched off a lobbying battle between two big stakeholders - Farm Belt backers who view sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as crucial to ethanol's growth and environmental advocates who say clearing land to grow crops for fuel is counterproductive to solving global warming. At issue is a requirement in last year's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that SAF producers seeking tax credits must demonstrate with an approved scientific model that their fuel generates 50% less greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle than petroleum fuel. Midwest ethanol producers have asked the Biden administration to adopt a model that would enable ethanol-based SAF to qualify while environmentalists want standards that would favor inputs like used cooking oil and animal fat. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency and agriculture and energy departments are divided over which model to use, and White House Climate Czar John Podesta is seeking to resolve the question, according to the sources. A White House official said the administration’s SAF policy seeks to include ethanol, but “we are trying to seek alignment with stakeholders on the question of modeling.” The EPA, Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment. The administration's decision will determine who benefits from billions of dollars in subsidies expected under the program. The administration is meant to announce a decision by September. The Biden administration has a goal to supply at least 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 as part of its broader effort to decarbonize the transport sector. By 2050, it hopes the SAF industry - which is now miniscule - will meet 100% of aviation fuel demand at around 35 billion gallons per year. The biofuels lobby, which has found allies among commercial airlines and farm state lawmakers, is arguing that the Biden administration cannot meet those targets if it blocks ethanol as an SAF feedstock and would hurt farmers in the meantime. ""Barring the aviation industry from embracing the most accessible SAF options will not only deprive American farmers of the chance to contribute to a new clean energy market, but also severely delay adoption of promising low-emission energy sources,"" a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday. Environmental groups including the Environmental Defense Fund and Friends of the Earth, meanwhile, say including ethanol would undermine the administration's climate goals because clearing land for fuel crops releases carbon from the soil. Biden, who has made tackling climate change a central pillar of his administration, has raised expectations among farmers. ""Mark my words: the next 20 years, farmers are going to be providing 95% of all the sustainable airline fuel,"" Biden told a crowd in Maine last week. The IRA says producers must use the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization, or a ""similar methodology"", for measuring SAF's emissions. The ethanol industry wants to use the U.S. Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model. CORSIA is more likely than GREET to exclude ethanol-based SAF from the subsidy program because of the way it evaluates the emissions of so-called indirect land-use change, the displacement of existing farmland or natural vegetation to grow crops. The administration is considering a compromise that would incorporate certain aspects of the GREET system into a new methodology, a source familiar with the matter said. However, it was unclear how that would work.",2023-08-02 20:43:54.139685,"

biofuel,Explainer: What is carbon capture and storage and will it cut emissions?,"July 31, 2023",https://reuters.com/sustainability/what-is-carbon-capture-storage-will-it-cut-emissions-2023-07-31/,"LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - The UK government on Monday reaffirmed its support for projects to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions as part of its efforts to reach net zero goals and said two more projects would be able to begin negotiations to take them forward. Britain already said in March it would invest 20 billion pounds ($25.7 billion) over the next 20 years in the technology and did not announce any extra cash on Monday. There are two main types of carbon capture and storage. Point-source carbon capture and storage (CCS) which captures CO2 produced at the source, such as a smokestack, while direct air capture (DAC) removes carbon dioxide (CO2) that has already been released into the atmosphere. The two new British projects to get government backing are Acorn - developed by Storegga, Shell, Harbour Energy and North Sea Midstream Partners - and the Viking project - led by Harbour Energy. They are both designed to capture emissions from heavy-emitting sectors, such as oil and gas refining and steel manufacturing, and store them underground off the coast of Britain in depleted oil and gas fields. Firstly, the CO2 has to be separated from other gases produced in industrial processes or during power generation. Once captured it has to be compressed and transported to sites for storage often via pipelines. After that, it has to be injected into rock formations underground - typically 1 km (0.62 mile) or more under the ground - for storage for decades. CCS has been in operation since the 1970s with more than 200 million tonnes of CO2 captured and stored deep underground globally, the Global CCS Institute says. Many projects however have failed to deliver the carbon savings promised. The world's largest commercial CCS project, Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) Gorgon project in Australia has struggled to hit capacity. A U.N. panel of scientists' report last year said CCS can help the world to reach global climate targets set under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, but that the focus needed to remain on preventing emissions from being emitted in the first place. Countries such as Britain expect the technology to help them reach their net zero targets, with Britain aiming to capture and store 20-30 million tonnes a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15 million cars. Some environmental groups, however, question how effectively CCS can curb emissions as the technology enables fossil fuel companies to operate for longer and can allow more oil and gas to be recovered from old fields. According to the Global CCS Institute, 61 facilities were added to the global project pipeline last year, bringing the total to more than 190. Of those, 30 were in operation, 11 were under construction and the remainder in various stages of development. CCUS - instead of just storing the CO2 - re-uses it in industrial processes such as plastics, concrete or biofuel manufacture. CCS technology is expensive and two thirds of lifetime costs are upfront expenditure, consultancy Wood Mackenzie says. Developers have blamed a lack of funding and the absence of a clear economic argument for building CCS projects for a global lack of progress. Individual project costs vary from $20/tonne of CO2 to $150/tonne depending on the technology type and source of captured emissions, Wood Mackenzie said in a 2022 report. It forecast costs could fall by 20%-25% over the next two decades. CCS with direct air capture is in the high triple digits per tonne, depending on the technology type.

The deal discussions come amid a supply crunch for lithium. Sigma earlier this year started production at the Grota do Cirilo hard rock lithium project in Brazil to supply roughly a fourth of its output to LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) with the rest slated for sale on the spot market. Bank of America has been Sigma's bank on retainer for some time and has been holding meetings for at least four months with parties that approach with interest in acquiring the lithium miner, Sigma CEO Ana Cabral-Gardner said in an interview. She added that the company ""is focused on alternatives that embrace the importance of our shareholders' values of social sustainability."" Bank of America declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported in February, citing sources, that automaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) was considering a bid for Vancouver-based Sigma, which is listed on Nasdaq and has a market value of $4.2 billion. ""What I can confirm is that since the rumors started in February, the management continues to work to understand strategic alternatives to strengthen Sigma's and Brazil's unique environmentally competitive position on the midstream of the global supply chain,"" said Cabral-Gardner. She is also managing partner of A10 Investimentos, which owns 44% of Sigma's shares. Cabral-Gardner said that while Bank of America is coordinating meetings with parties that approach Sigma, Sigma has not yet picked a bank to advise on any potential transaction. ""Maybe I'm not selling. Maybe I'm partnering with someone. I don't know what I'm doing yet,"" Cabral-Gardner said in the interview.

""The priest is going to depend on who we're going to marry."" Cabral-Gardner added that Sigma does not plan to sell the Brazilian mine separately from the company itself. ""The company is the asset,"" she said. Because lithium demand is low in biofuel-focused Brazil, the country exports nearly all of it.

It also clarifies that red flags were found in previous audits and adds the ISCC statement on policy to not give details of reasons for suspending certification.) Auditors suspended the sustainable fuel certification of three Chinese biofuel exporters after flagging potential issues with the sourcing of waste oil from Malaysia and Indonesia. Germany last month triggered a European Union investigation into a large volume of biofuels imports into Europe from China to assess whether the fuel meets EU sustainability criteria. The Germany-based International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) company, which oversees certification of fuel as sustainable, listed the three companies as having their sustainable certification suspended in its online database. The companies suspended were Hainan Hanpu Import and Export Trade, Hainan Bomi Import and Export Trading and Wuchuan Maosheng Bio-energy. The two Hainan-island based companies had their certification suspended in June and remain suspended. Wuchuan Maoshing had a one-month suspension that was lifted at the end of May, according to the database. The suspensions, which had not previously been reported, meant the companies could not export biofuel to the European Union. The ISCC declined to give more detail on the reasons for the suspensions when requested by Reuters. It said that as a policy it ""can and will not publish specific reasons for the suspension and withdrawal of a certificate."" Previous audit reports, however, cited the companies' inaccuracy of records, lack of traceability of sustainable materials and mislabeling of raw materials as potential risk factors for sustainability certification. The three Chinese companies and their ISCC-registered auditors - TÜV Nord, RINA and the China Quality Certification Centre - did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. EU incentives for biodiesel production made with waste oils and fat to increase renewable energy use have encouraged companies in Asia to mix biofuels with cheaper oils, especially palm oil and export them to Europe, according to top European industry body EWABA. The European Waste-based & Advanced Biofuels Association warned last month that a flood of potentially ""dubious or fraudulent"" biodiesel imports into Europe from China could trigger the collapse of the EU's biofuels industry. Audit documents for the three suspended firms listed their raw materials as coming in part from palm oil from Indonesia or Malaysia. Palm oil from the two countries is subject to steep European import duties because the EU does not classify palm oil as sustainable. The Yangpu-based firms are among the largest biofuel blenders on Hainan Island, while the mainland-based company trades in biofuel with those companies, two European trade sources said.",2023-08-02 20:43:54.139685,"

The 1.6 billion euro construction of the Singapore Expansion Project - which started at the beginning of 2019 - was expected to add 2.6 million tons of fuel capacity per annum. That includes up to 1 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is key to make planes greener as it cuts carbon emissions by up to 80%. But the rollout of the facility has suffered delays due to equipment repairs and maintenance shutdowns. Neste is now predicting that it will produce 230,000 tons less of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel in the second half of 2023. That’s bad news for the fight against climate change. The industry has made little progress in reducing polluting emissions from jets and planes. Neste's production problems will further complicate the aviation race to net zero.

biofuel,Robin Hood tariff could curb airline emissions,"July 24, 2023",https://reuters.com/breakingviews/robin-hood-tariff-could-curb-airline-emissions-2023-07-24/,"TINOS, GREECE, July 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Some readers, especially those in the northern hemisphere, may be feeling “flight shame” this summer. How can they justify jetting on holiday when temperatures are soaring across Europe, America and China? I am acutely aware of this, working from home in Greece where forest fires have been raging. Guilt is useful if it provokes action. In this case, the main solution is not for individuals to stop flying voluntarily. It is to transform the airline industry so that it doesn’t fry the planet. A key part would be to tax aviation fuel, with the richest countries and the most frequent flyers bearing the biggest burden. Aviation isn’t the planet’s biggest polluter. Nevertheless, aircraft are responsible for about 4% of global warming from carbon emissions and the vapour trails they leave behind in the sky. What’s more, the industry is growing fast. Without evasive action, it will contribute an even bigger portion of future increases in the global temperature. New types of planes powered by electric batteries or hydrogen would help. But they won’t be able to do much of the job until the middle of the century. A more viable short-term option is to run planes on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Even so the cheapest of these, biofuel, still costs about two to three times as much as kerosene, the traditional jet fuel. Biofuel uses things like cooking oil waste as its feedstock. But it’s not possible to scale it up to replace all jet fuel. Synthetic fuel, such as e-kerosene made from green hydrogen, doesn’t suffer from that problem. But it is even more expensive, costing seven to ten times the price of conventional jet fuel. The process of creating green hydrogen by electrolysing water with renewable energy and then combining it with carbon dioxide is also inherently complex. As fuel accounts for around 30% of airlines’ costs the industry isn’t going to use much SAF voluntarily. There are three ways to get the industry to switch. The first is to subsidise sustainable fuels, as the U.S. government is doing with its SAF Grand Challenge to support research, development and early deployment of new technologies. That could help kickstart the industry. But synthetic fuels will still probably be 1.5-2.5 times the price of traditional fuels by the middle of the century. Even rich governments won’t keep bridging the gap with subsidies for several decades. A second solution is to force airlines to use SAF. The European Union, for example, is requiring 6% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF by 2030; 1.2% of the fuel must be synthetic. But these are still small quantities. The third option is to tax either the kerosene that airlines burn or the emissions they spew out into the atmosphere. This would push up the price of conventional fuel, narrowing the gap with SAF. So far only the EU, United Kingdom and some smaller countries are doing this via emissions trading schemes (ETS). These require airlines to get permits for every tonne of carbon they emit on flights within Europe. These currently cost about 90 euros per tonne. But even the EU’s efforts are limited. Back in 2012 the bloc wanted to include flights leaving Europe in the scheme but backed down when countries including China and the United States objected. This is one reason that the EU is under-taxing the airline industry by 26 billion euros a year, according to the non-profit group Transport and Environment. The world’s governments could, in theory, impose a global tax on kerosene via the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United Nations agency that regulates the industry. They started such a process to tax shipping emissions via that industry’s equivalent UN agency earlier this month. But so far there’s little momentum to adopt a similar approach to airlines. French President Emmanuel Macron is one of the few leaders calling for a global tax. There are multiple blockages. One is that the United States hasn’t yet imposed carbon taxes on any industry. Another is that developing countries don’t see why their airlines should pay up for emissions when their populations don’t fly much and have contributed relatively little to climate damage. The ICAO has agreed a carbon offset scheme, which takes full effect in 2027. This requires airlines to compensate for the carbon they emit above recent levels by putting money into projects that cut emissions in other industries. But this is unlikely to make much difference, not least because the price of offsets is expected to be a fraction of the cost of the EU’s ETS permits. The ICAO did last year agree on an “aspirational” long-term goal of cutting the industry’s emissions to zero by 2050 on a net basis. If governments are serious, they will need a plan to hit this target. To work, the plan would need to channel Robin Hood, the legendary English outlaw who stole from the rich to give to the poor. Airlines operating in wealthy countries will either have to pay higher taxes than their rivals in less-developed parts of the world, or rich governments will need to give a big chunk of the taxes they raise to poor countries. Another possibility is for those passengers who fly the most, the bulk of whom are in rich countries, to pay a “frequent flyer levy” which rises the more often they travel by air. The International Council on Clean Transportation has proposed a plan to raise $121 billion a year with such a scheme. The levy would be set at zero for a traveller’s first flight in a year, rising to $177 for their twentieth trip. Rich countries might baulk. But they should realise that taxing kerosene would not only narrow the gap with more sustainable fuels, but would also provide revenue to fund subsidies to close it further. What’s more, it’s worth the developed world giving some of this money to poor countries as part of a global deal rather than putting its own aviation industry at a competitive disadvantage. Cracking this problem will be a long haul. Readers who feel flight shame could start by making it clear they would be happy to pay higher levies the more they fly.

Russia has said it was still committed to its climate targets despite the deepest political rift with the West in decades. Biofuels are widely considered to be less harmful in terms of emissions than conventional fuels. Gazprom Neft's bunkering business subsidiary, Gazprom Neft Marin Bunker, said it was the first company in Russia to feed a vessel with marine fuel blended with biofuel in the Baltic Sea port of St. Petersburg. It said the new fuel is in compliance with technical regulations and can be used for most sea and river vessels. Vkusno & tochka, or ""Tasty and that's it"", which took over from McDonald's in Russia last year after the U.S. hamburger chain shut restaurants and exited the market in opposition to Russia's actions in Ukraine, is part of the project as well as a company called Ecoway. Vkusno & tochka already supplies waste cooking oil for production of biofuel used for heating of electric-powered buses in Moscow and has been recycling used cooking oil for over a decade. ""The test fuelling in St. Petersburg showed that the new green fuel, in terms of its technical characteristics, is fully consistent with traditional petroleum products, while its use significantly reduces the carbon footprint,"" said Anton Soboled, the director general of Gazprom Neft Marin Bunker. Irina Korshunova, in charge of sustainable development at Vkusno & tochka, said the company processes around 5,500 tonnes of waste cooking oil each year. ""Now, part of the processed products will be used as a bio-component for marine fuel. For the company, this is an important and conscious step in the implementation of the sustainable development strategy,"" she said.",2023-08-02 20:43:54.139685,"

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has the authority to issue the waivers, on Friday denied exemption requests from 15 small refineries in a move that corn farmers and ethanol producers welcomed. Refiners including Par Pacific Holdings Inc (PARR.N) plan to join together in a legal challenge against the decision, a Par Pacific spokesperson told Reuters. ""We believe EPA's decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law,"" said Ashimi Patel with Par Pacific. Par Pacific and CVR Energy (CVI.N) have some of the largest outstanding obligations. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix or buy credits - known as RINs - from those that do. The EPA can, however, award exemptions to some small refiners if they prove that the obligations cause them undue harm. ""We will continue to fight for our rights that we believe Wynnewood (Oklahoma refinery) is entitled to,"" CVR Energy Chief Executive David Lamp said during the company's first quarter earnings call in May, before the EPA's decision last week. Par Pacific's gross RINs and environmental credit obligations stood at $347 million at the end of the first quarter 2023, based on market pricing then, a company filing showed. CVR Energy's outstanding liability was about $582 million at the end of the first quarter, another filing showed.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has the authority to issue the exemptions, denied 26 petitions from 15 small refineries who applied for waivers for the 2016-2018 and 2021-2023 compliance years, the agency said on Friday. There are still two pending petitions. The agency also disclosed which oil refiners submitted petitions in July 2022 or later, as well as which oil refiners are participating in an alternative compliance schedule that allows them flexibility in complying with biofuel blending laws. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. The EPA can, however, award exemptions to some small refiners if they prove that the obligations cause them undue harm. Biden has been trying to set the United States on track to reduce carbon emissions in the fight against climate change, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The administration has not yet extended a waiver to any refinery, reversing the policy of former President Donald Trump, whose administration granted 34 exemptions to oil refiners for the 2017 compliance year alone. The EPA consulted with the Department of Energy on Friday's waiver decisions and found that none of the petitioning small refineries demonstrated they face disproportionate economic hardship caused by their RFS compliance, the agency said. The EPA publicized on Friday the names of refiners that submitted small-refinery exemption petitions from July 2022 or later. The agency added this information to its website to reflect its commitment to transparency around RFS decisions, it said. Refiners that submitted petitions included Calumet Montana Refining and Ergon Refining. Their petitions were denied. The agency also publicized the names of refiners that are using an alternative schedule to prove RFS compliance. Among those listed were Sinclair Wyoming Refining Company and Kern Oil and Refining Company. Data from the EPA showed 17 small refineries have opted into the alternative compliance schedule for the 2020 compliance year, the only compliance year shown in the data.

The proposal would reduce rising compliance costs associated with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and aim to help struggling refineries stay afloat at a time of great flux in the global energy markets, lawmakers said. As part of the standard, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. Oil refiners argue the mandates are pricey, while biofuel proponents like ethanol producers and corn farmers like the obligations because it increases the market for their products. Under the proposed bill, refiners could buy credits around conventional biofuel blending, which includes corn-based ethanol blending, at the fixed price if they are not able to obtain them in the market at cost-effective levels, according to a news release. News of the bill caused prices for the credits, known as RINs, to dip. ""We can and must do more to address volatile and soaring compliance costs driven by fuel mandates that are out of step with domestic fuel demand,” said Chris Coons, who introduced the bill along with fellow Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican U.S. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick. It is unclear whether the measure, unveiled on Tuesday, will pass. Issues around the RFS typically draw strong lobbying efforts from both oil refining advocates and biofuel advocates. The bill must pass both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House of Representatives before it could reach President Joe Biden's desk, who would decide whether to sign it into law.

According to the report Asia Biofuel Outlook, produced by research firm BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, India's pursuit of increased ethanol blending in gasoline, as a way to cut the oil products' import bill and reduce carbon emissions, will continue to support global sugar prices. BMI says that there is currently a fast development of additional capacity to produce ethanol in India, where the biofuel is made mainly from sugarcane. As more ethanol plants start production, more of the country's sugarcane crop will be used to make the fuel, limiting the amount of sugar that will be produced. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), India's ethanol blending has reached 11.5%, while the country's government target is to reach 20% by 2025. The report said that although it is ""doubtful"" that India will be able to achieve that by 2025, the program will cap exports of feedstocks used in ethanol production. BMI noted that Indonesia is also getting back to an ethanol blending program with a 5% rate initially, and a target to get to 10% by 2030. The research firm said that the country would need to sharply increase sugarcane planting to reach that target, and it would probably need to import ethanol to do it.

""The assessment on the windfall tax is a matter for the finance minister, and it is also related also to the (guidelines of the) European Union,"" minister Pichetto Fratin said. ""It is clear that, with a view to achieving a normalisation, we all hope there should be no tax (on 2023 profits),"" he added, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of the Italian industrial lobby for energy. Rome expects to collect this year more than 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion) through a one-off windfall tax calculated on the part of 2022 corporate income which is at least 10% higher than the average income reported between 2018 and 2021. The scheme replaced a similar levy in force last year which has triggered criticism and refusals to pay from multiple firms. Attending the same event, Edison CEO Nicola Monti said the 2022 levy had increased the tax rate on the group to 72%, a level he labelled as unacceptable. The energy minister said that Italy had sent a list of projects to tap European Union funds under the REPowerEU scheme, adding that a decision by Brussels over which investments to fund was expected by August. The list of projects sent to the European Commission does not include an additional floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, the minister said but refrained from mentioning other proposals. A project for carbon capture and storage led by energy group Eni (ENI.MI) and gas grid group Snam (SRG.MI) has been included in the list of proposals, senior Eni executive Guido Brusco said. REPowerEU is designed to cut consumption, help diversify supply and enable the shift to cleaner energy.

Chacraservicios, which is focused on the cultivation of Camelina sativa, a crop with high oil content, will contribute to Bunge and Chevron's global supply chains by adding a new oil source to meet the growing demand for lower carbon renewable feedstocks, the companies said. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Renewable diesel emits lesser emissions by roughly 4.2% for carbon dioxide from the same volume of regular diesel, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, when compared with both biodiesel and regular diesel. That makes it attractive to logistics firms and other companies seeking to lower their supply chain pollution levels. Expanding production of renewable diesel depends on increasing the supply of oils made from crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday cut its estimate of how many acres of soybeans, a key source of vegetable oil, had been planted.

However, selling in corn may have been revived late last week on a highly bearish U.S. supply outlook. Chicago corn, wheat, soybean and soybean meal futures began rallying sharply in mid-June as expanding U.S. drought and disappointing rain events hammered crop conditions. Corn, soybeans and meal topped on June 21 but eased significantly in the following sessions on improved weather forecasts. In the week ended June 27, money managers cut their net long in CBOT corn futures and options to 52,845 contracts from 58,299 a week earlier, which included reductions in both long and shorts. Trade sources had pegged the week’s net corn selling to be about four times heavier. December corn futures fell 6.1% in the week ended June 27 but had been up as much as 5.4% on June 21. The contract fell almost 12% between Wednesday and Friday, settling at $4.94-3/4 per bushel, the lowest since October 2021 and off 21% from the June 21 peak. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday revealed U.S. farmers had planted far more corn acres than analysts expected, amplifying the corn sell-off that has been mostly weather-driven. Soybean acres came in far below expectations, causing November beans to jump 6% on Friday. Soybean futures shed 3.6% in the week ended June 27 after max gains of 2.6% on June 21, though money managers increased their net long to 99,480 futures and options contracts from 76,950 a week earlier, mostly on new longs but including some short covering. Modest selling had been expected. December soymeal fell 4.3% through June 27 after max gains of 7.5% on June 21, which curbed the week’s selling. Money managers reduced their meal net long to 58,980 futures and options contracts from 63,924 in the prior week, in line with expectations. CBOT wheat futures rose 0.5% in the week ended June 27, though the contract had surged as much as 10.7% by June 26. Money managers executed a second consecutive week of heavy short covering in wheat, slashing their net short to 52,168 futures and options contracts from 84,134. That marked funds’ least bearish CBOT wheat view since November, and the two weeks ended June 27 featured speculators’ heaviest spree of short covering in six years. Gross longs were slightly reduced in both weeks. Price action in CBOT soybean oil was opposite from the others, as futures eased nearly 1% in the week ended June 27 but had been down as much as 11% with traders interpreting U.S. biofuel blending mandates negatively. Money managers covered bean oil shorts and added new longs through June 27, increasing their net long to 38,751 futures and options contracts, their most bullish view since January and up from 29,817 in the prior week. CBOT November soybeans rose nearly 4% in the last three sessions and the soy products both added more than 3%, including a limit-up move for soybean oil on Friday. December soyoil’s Friday close of 58.97 cents per pound was the highest since early March. CBOT wheat fell almost 7% between Wednesday and Friday, weighed down by corn’s 12% losses. Wheat took a back seat to corn and soybeans Friday, though USDA's estimate of June 1 U.S. wheat stocks and 2023 wheat plantings came in below analyst predictions. Trade sources peg funds’ net selling in CBOT corn futures at 55,500 contracts over the last three sessions, and CBOT wheat selling is seen at 20,500 futures contracts. Funds were seen as net buyers of 8,000 soybean futures, 9,500 soyoil futures and 3,500 soymeal futures between Wednesday and Friday. Money managers’ weekly net selling in CBOT corn futures and options has twice exceeded 100,000 contracts this calendar year. Their biggest net buying week in soybeans so far is 46,442 futures and options contracts in early April, though net buying in the latest four weeks is near 100,000 contracts.
