crude oil,Asia stocks hover near 16-month peak; Aussie slides after RBA,"August 1, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2023-08-01/,"TOKYO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks hovered close to a sixteen-month peak on Tuesday and oil held near recent highs as investors found more cause for cheer over global economic prospects than reasons to worry, even as data showed risks remain. The dollar hit a three-week high against the yen as investors continued to seek clarity on the Bank of Japan's recent adjustment to its yield curve control and what that might mean for monetary policy. The Aussie dollar slumped after the Reserve Bank kept rates unchanged, even as it suggested more tightening may be needed in the future. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares (.MIAP00000PUS) edged slightly higher, inching back toward the high reached Monday, which was its strongest level since April of last year. Japan's Nikkei (.N225) provided support, gaining 0.83% on the back of a weaker yen. U.S. E-mini stock futures also pointed to a small rise after the S&P 500 (.SPX) ticked up 0.15% overnight. ""We're in a kind of economic nirvana, with an incredibly resilient economy, solid earnings reports and cooling inflation,"" said Tony Sycamore, a markets analyst at IG in Sydney. ""A little more than halfway through the year, it feels like we're in a very good spot."" Signs of a peaking out in European inflation on Monday echoed the narrative in the United States, providing more evidence that the biggest central banks are nearing the end of their tightening cycles. However, China's stumbling post-pandemic recovery remained in focus after a surprise contraction in manufacturing in a private-sector survey released Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (.HSI) shed early advance to be about flat, with its property subindex (.HSMPI) flipping from gains to slide 1.47% as investors took profits after the previous day's rally, built on stimulus hopes. An index of mainland Chinese blue chips (.CSI300) drooped 0.36%. ""At this point, we remain sceptical that there will be any big-bang stimulus package forthcoming,"" said Alec Jin, investment director of Asian equities at abrdn. ""Investors are still waiting to see some meaningful comeback in high frequency indicators."" The positive U.S. narrative also faces some crucial tests this week, with several closely watched jobs reports due, culminating with monthly payrolls on Friday. Corporate earnings later in the day include global bellwether Caterpillar. In currencies, the U.S. dollar index - which measures the currency against six major peers - rose as high as 102.07 for the first time since July 10. That was aided by a continued retreat in the yen to a three-week low of 142.84 per dollar , as investors looked past the BOJ's surprise tweak of its 10-year yield ceiling to view changes to the negative short-term rate as a still distant prospect. A closely watched auction of 10-year notes saw relatively weak demand, although the yield reacted little, sticking around 0.6%, well back from the new de facto cap at 1%. The Aussie weakened as much as 0.9% to $0.66575 after the RBA opted to keep policy steady for a second meeting running. Markets had priced 70% odds for no action, and 30% probability of a hike. ""It's unsurprising that the knee-jerk reaction is negative, but I wouldn't expect it to be onwards and downwards for Aussie,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, who predicts a recovery toward $0.70 in coming weeks if risk sentiment stays positive. ""On a valuation basis, (Aussie) is looking pretty cheap."" Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday, trading near a three-month high reached on Monday, on signs of tightening global supply, as producers implement output cuts, and strong demand in the United States, the world's biggest fuel consumer. Brent crude futures for October were down 0.2% or 18 cents at $85.25 a barrel. Front-month Brent settled at its highest since April 13 on Monday.

Brent crude futures for October were at $85.25 a barrel at 0402 GMT, down 18 cents or 0.2% lower from its close. Front-month Brent settled at its highest since April 13 on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $81.64 a barrel, down 0.2% or 16 cents from the previous session's settlement, which was its highest since April 14. ""Oil prices may face a correction risk as the markets may have been overbought in the past month. However, a softened U.S. dollar and China's policy optimism may continue to provide bullish factors to crude futures,"" said Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets, as a weaker greenback makes dollar-priced oil cheaper for holders of other currencies. ""Signs of a soft-landing U.S. economy has also improved oil's demand outlooks,"" Teng added. Chinese authorities released additional policy guidelines on Monday - though without concrete measures - to boost its economy and domestic consumption, after manufacturing activity fell for a fourth month in July. A private sector survey also showed on Tuesday that China's factory activity swung to contraction in July, with supply, demand and export orders all deteriorating amid sluggish market conditions. National Australia Bank (NAB) analysts expect oil prices to hit 2023 price highs ahead of this Friday's ministerial meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+. ""The OPEC meeting this Friday is a potential catalyst for the outlook where we expect Saudi Arabia's voluntary supply cuts to be extended another month,"" NAB said in a Tuesday note. In June, OPEC+ agreed on a broad deal to limit oil supply into 2024, and Saudi Arabia pledged an additional voluntary cut of 1 million barrels per day for July. On July 3, Saudi Arabia said the cut would include August, adding that it could be extended further. The Saudi Arabian cuts fell slightly short of the target, with output down by 860,000 bpd in July, while total production from OPEC was 840,000 bpd lower, a Reuters survey showed on Monday. The data showing the supply cuts coincided with U.S. figures released on Monday showing fuel demand rose to 20.78 million bpd in May, the highest since August 2019. The data from the Energy Information Administration also showed gasoline demand, expressed as product supplied to the market, surged to 9.11 million bpd, the highest since June 2022. U.S. crude oil and gasoline stockpiles were expected to have declined last week, according to a Reuters poll which estimated on average that crude inventories fell by about 900,000 barrels in the week to July 28.",2023-08-01 11:36:32.597203,"

crude oil,Saudi Arabia may raise Sept crude prices for a third month,"August 1, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/commodities/saudi-arabia-may-raise-sept-crude-prices-third-month-2023-08-01/,"SINGAPORE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, may raise its price for Arab Light crude for sale to Asian refiners for a third month as its voluntary output cuts may be extended, further tightening the supply of high-sulphur, or sour, crude. State-owned Saudi Aramco may raise the official selling price (OSP) for its flagship Arab Light crude in September by about 45 cents from August to $3.65 a barrel above Oman/Dubai quotes, which would be the grade's highest premium this year, a Reuters survey of five refining sources showed. Saudi Arabia has said it will cut its production by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in July and August on top of broad reductions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, to limit oil supply into 2024 to support prices. Market participants and analysts forecast Saudi Arabia will extend the voluntary cut for another month to include September when OPEC+ holds its monthly Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting on Aug. 4. ""It's always hard to make prediction on Saudi's OSPs. But the rollover of the 1 million bpd cut is seen as a baseline in September price assessments,"" said one respondent. The supply reductions have boosted oil prices, particularly for sour crude, since the end of June. The supply tightness is reflected in the widening of the backwardation during July in the first- and third-month price spread for Middle East benchmark crude Dubai, an indicator that typically guides how much Saudi Aramco might raise or cut Arab Light's OSP. Backwardation is the pricing structure where prices for prompt supply are higher than those in future months, suggesting less supply and higher demand for oil. The backwardation in the spread widened by 43 cents a barrel in July, indicating the OSP will rise by a similar amount. Arab Light prices are also supported by improving refining margins in Asia, in particular for middle distillates. Profits at a typical Singapore refinery processing Dubai crude averaged $10.60 a barrel in July, the highest in seven months. Most of the survey respondents expected Saudi Arabia to raise prices for heavier grades Arab Medium and Arab Heavy by more than Arab Extra Light as the light crude is oversupplied. The Arab Extra Light OSP typically tracks premiums of Murban, a light sour crude from the United Arab Emirates. In July, Murban prices were pressured by arbitrage crude from the Americas and West Africa as the spread between benchmarks Brent and Dubai narrowed. Saudi Aramco's OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting about 9 million bpd of crude bound for Asia. Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the its monthly OSPs. Below are the expected Saudi Aramco official selling prices for September 2023 (in $/bbl against the Oman/Dubai average):",2023-08-01 11:36:32.597203,"

crude oil,"Analysis: Pakistan's imports of Russian crude face port, refinery, currency constraints","August 1, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/commodities/pakistans-imports-russian-crude-face-port-refinery-currency-constraints-2023-07-31/,"KARACHI, Pakistan, July 31 (Reuters) - Pakistan is unlikely to meet a target for Russian crude to make up two-thirds of its oil imports, despite attractive prices, hampered by a shortage of foreign currency and limitations at its refineries and ports, officials and analysts say. The cash-strapped South Asian nation became Russia's latest customer snapping up discounted crude that has been banned from European markets due to Russia's war on Ukraine. Its first cargo arrived in June and a second is now under negotiation. It is targeting 100,000 bpd of imports from Russia, compared with the total 154,000 bpd of crude it imported in 2022, in the hopes that will lower its import bill, address a foreign exchange crisis and keep a lid on record high inflation. However, the benefits are being offset by increased shipping costs and lower quality refined products compared with the fuels produced with crude from Pakistan's main suppliers, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan will have to increase gasoline and gasoil imports to make up for the lower output of these fuels from the Russian crude, leading to more dollar outflows and stress on its crisis-hit economy, said Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at Pakistan-based FRIM Ventures. While Islamabad and Moscow have not disclosed pricing details and the extent of discounts, a shortage of Chinese yuan currency to pay for Russian crude poses another hurdle, as it needs the yuan for trade with China, its top trade partner. Pakistan paid for its first Russian crude cargo in Chinese yuan. However, Aadil Nakhoda, assistant professor at Karachi's Institute of Business Administration, said it would be better for the country to use a barter deal with Russia than paying with yuan, which traders say is in short supply. ""How will it pay other lenders and how will it finance trade with China if it uses the low yuan reserves to pay for Russian oil?"" Nakhoda said. Adding to the challenges, transportation costs for Russian crude are higher than for Middle Eastern crudes not only because of the longer distance traveled, but because Pakistan's ports cannot handle the large vessels departing Russia. Urals crude had to be transferred from a supertanker on to smaller ships, known as a lightering operation, in Oman before heading to Pakistan, government officials said, unlike direct shipments from the Middle East. Even with that extra cost, it was worth importing Russian oil, said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler, as Saudi Arab Light crude is $10 to $11 per barrel more expensive for Pakistani refiners than Urals, while lightering operations add around $2 to $3 per barrel. ""Pakistani buyers would still be much better off,"" he said. However, Urals quality is a deterrent, as Pakistan's refineries cannot get as much gasoline and diesel out of Urals crude as they produce from Saudi and UAE crudes. It will take Pakistan Refinery Ltd (PRL) at least two months to fully process its first cargo of 100,000 metric tons (730,000 barrels) of Urals crude as it needs to be blended with Middle East crude to offset the high output of fuel oil from the Russian oil, Zahid Mir, chief executive of the state-run refiner, told Reuters. ""Our optimum processing solution is to blend Urals with Middle Eastern imported crude while not exceeding 50% Ural in the blend,"" Mir said. The residual fuel produced from Urals crude has to be mixed with diesel and kerosene to meet specifications for local use while the remainder is exported, but the deal was still commercially viable for Pakistan, Mir said. PRL has no plans to upgrade its refinery to process fuel oil into higher quality fuels, he added. Kpler's Katona expects Pakistan's liquidity issues and technical challenges to weigh on its appetite for Russian crude. ""Russian imports into Pakistan will not grow into anything bigger than one cargo per month,"" he said.",2023-08-01 11:36:32.597203,"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.28% to 35,560.19, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.15% to 4,589.15 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 0.21% to 14,346.02.

European shares gained modestly after euro zone inflation fell further in July seeing that most measures of underlying price growth also eased. Markets took this as a comforting sign for the European Central Bank (ECB) as it considers ending a brutal string of interest rate hikes. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose by 0.12%, a second consecutive monthly gain. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.15%. The modest gains came despite China's manufacturing activity falling for a fourth straight month in July, as demand remained weak at home and abroad, official surveys showed on Monday. ""Markets are treating information with a lot more sensitivity and people are looking into new information with a detailed eye,"" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Economic indicators that investors will be watching this week include the U.S. ISM surveys on manufacturing and services, as well as the July payrolls report. ""Data out this week should remain superficially consistent with the 'soft landing' narrative,"" Citi market strategists wrote in a note. ""But the potential return to upside surprises to job growth would raise questions about whether slowing inflation can coexist with tight labor markets."" All three main U.S. indexes have posted recent gains as signs of cooling inflation and a resilient economy have eased investor sentiment about the economy surviving amid higher rates for longer.

Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute's head of global investment strategy, urged caution given the potential for a weaker economy, slower disinflation and narrower corporate profits. ""This year's impressive equity rally has been driven by strong sentiment, without either the earnings growth or the directional improvement in economic data to justify current market multiples and valuations,"" Christopher wrote in a note. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Monday said the U.S. central bank is ""walking the line pretty well"" on bringing inflation down without causing a recession, and will watch the data as September approaches to judge if more monetary tightening may be appropriate. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise rates by at least a quarter point. Traders cut bets on a continuing rally in the pound by the most since mid-June ahead of the Bank of England rate decision on Thursday. Sterling has surged 24% from a record low of $1.033 against the dollar in September after a disastrous budget, hitting a 15-month high of $1.314 in mid-July. The dollar edged higher on Monday after a survey from the Federal Reserve showed U.S. banks reported tighter credit standards and weaker loan demand during the second quarter, a sign rising interest rates are having an impact on the economy. The Japanese yen weakened about 0.8% versus the dollar . Investors continued to digest Friday's decision by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lift the lid on bond yields in a step away from its ultra-easy policies. Japanese 10-year yields surged to a nine-year high up to 0.6% on Monday, and toward the new cap of 1.0%. U.S. Treasury yields were marginally lower, with investors waiting for employment data to assess the impact of the Fed's monetary tightening campaign on the economy. The 10-year was down 1 basis point at 3.961%.

The September Brent contract, which expired at settlement on Monday, rose 0.7% to close at $85.56 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rallied $1.22, or 1.5%, to $81.80 a barrel. Both Brent and WTI hit their highest since late April for a third consecutive session on Monday, after notching their fifth straight weekly gains on Friday.

crude oil,"Ecuadorean votes could bar oil output in Amazon reserve, mining near Quito","August 1, 2023",https://reuters.com/world/americas/ecuadorean-votes-could-bar-oil-output-amazon-reserve-mining-near-quito-2023-07-31/,"QUITO, July 31 (Reuters) - Ecuadoreans will decide in two August referendums whether oil and mining projects in key regions of the country can continue, weighing Indigenous and environmental concerns against billions in potential lost income. The South American country could lose about 12% of its 480,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) crude oil output if voters approve shuttering the 43-ITT block in the megadiverse Yasuni nature reserve in the Amazon, while a local referendum in Quito would bar mining in the Choco Andino forest, scuppering six gold concessions. Environmental activists and communities near the sites say the bans are necessary to protect nature, fight climate change and, in the case of the Yasuni vote, safeguard some Indigenous Waorani people who are voluntarily isolated. But oil and mining guilds say their industries are needed to shore up Ecuador's battered economy and that bans would expose the areas to illegal mining and deforestation. Outgoing President Guillermo Lasso, who moved ahead elections after lawmakers attempted to oust him, has failed to raise oil production or attract more mining investment as violence and social problems have worsened. A ""yes"" vote in both referendums could complicate finances for his successor. ""We want to keep our territory safe and healthy. They say when they take crude they bring health, education, but we don't see anything, there's no development,"" Ene Nenquimo, a national Waorani leader, told Reuters during a visit to Yasuni communities. ""The government, from its desk, just sees trees. ... But we live here."" A single hectare (2.5 acres) of the Yasuni has 650 species of trees, more than the whole of North America, as well as hundreds of species of birds, mammals, reptiles and fish, according to the environment ministry. Voters seem to be leaning toward yes votes in both referendums, said Santiago Pérez, head of pollster Clima Social, who has conducted surveys for his clients. ""I think as the population gets better informed and learns more about Yasuni and the Choco Andino that will favor the yes options,"" he said. State oil company Petroecuador says a ""yes"" on the Yasuni referendum would cost the country $13.8 billion in income over the next two decades. Platforms in the ITT have up to 39 wells each to minimize the space they occupy, Petroecuador head Ramon Correa told journalists in mid-July. ""The park has had the best protection practices,"" Correa said. Two other Petroecuador blocks in the area would be unaffected by the vote. Former President Rafael Correa authorized the ITT fields after an unsuccessful effort to raise funds from the international community in exchange for barring development. Despite improving technology and care, oil development in the Yasuni has hurt the environment and is threatening residents, including those who are voluntarily isolated, said Pedro Bermeo of advocacy group Yasunidos, which has been pushing for the referendum for a decade. ""They told us there wouldn't be roads, that there wouldn't be electricity generation, nor flares, and there is a huge impact,"" Bermeo said. Suspension of eventual full production in the ITT block would avoid the emission of 400 tonnes of carbon dioxide, says Yasunidos, though the group did not provide a time frame for the figure. Petroecuador says there are no flares at the block, that it occupies 0.01% of the reserve's 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) and that roads are environmentally-friendly. Meanwhile, opposition to mining is blocking some $1 billion in potential investment for the next two years, says Ecuador's Chamber of Mining, though a major project by Australia's SolGold (SOLG.L) is moving ahead. Mining was Ecuador's fourth-largest source of income last year, behind sales of oil, bananas and shrimp, bringing in $2.8 billion. ""It's not moral that we stop an industry which could create many opportunities over untrue fears,"" said Maria Eulalia Silva, the Chamber's president, adding that barring legal production is unlikely to stop animal trafficking, illegal mining or illicit logging. But residents say mining will threaten high altitude wetlands, water and animals like the spectacled bear. ""Mining will create water pollution, exploitation of the earth and destruction,"" said Morelia Fuentes, a resident of a small agricultural community inside the forest.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 27.34 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, the survey found, down 840,000 bpd from June. That's the lowest since September 2021 according to Reuters surveys. Saudi Arabia pledged to cut output by 1 million bpd in July as part of OPEC+'s deal in June which limits supply into 2024. Oil has begun to rally in response, with Brent crude trading above $85 a barrel, up from near $71 in late June. The Saudi move, which Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman called a ""Saudi lollipop,"" came on to top of earlier voluntary cuts that Riyadh and several other members of OPEC+ had announced, and added to reductions made under a late 2022 OPEC+ agreement. Increases in Angola and Iraq due to higher exports limited the decline in OPEC output in July, the survey found. OPEC's output is still undershooting the targeted amount by almost 1 million bpd partly because Nigeria and Angola lack the capacity to pump as much as their agreed level. Saudi Arabia lowered output by 860,000 bpd month-on-month, the survey found.

Since last week's coup, in which military leaders detained Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum and established a military government, China says it is closely monitoring the situation, and urges parties in Niger to safeguard stability. China's total foreign direct investment (FDI) into Niger stood at $2.68 billion as at the end of 2020, according to the U.S. Embassy in Niger. Following are China's main investments in Niger, predominantly by state energy giant PetroChina and national nuclear firm CNNC: Niger became an oil producer in 2011 when the Agadem oilfield, a joint venture between the government and PetroChina (601857.SS), started production. PetroChina entered a production sharing agreement in 2008 with the Nigerien government to develop the field, located some 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of the capital Niamey, with estimated reserves of 650 million barrels. As part of the deal, PetroChina invested in the construction of the SORAZ refinery, located 460km away in the southern city of Zinder, near the border with Nigeria. PetroChina holds a 60% stake in the refinery, which has a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) and mostly supplies the Nigerien domestic fuel market. The remaining share is held by the Nigerien government. In September 2019, PetroChina entered into another agreement with the Nigerien government to lay a 2,000-km (1,200 miles) pipeline between the Agadem field and the Beninese port city of Cotonou. The pipeline investment is twinned with a second phase of development of the Agadem field. Taken together, total investment into the pipeline and second phase development is expected to reach $4 billion, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. The pipeline, the longest of its kind in Africa, is planned to mitigate the security and logistical challenges of exporting crude from the troubled area, and designed to carry 90,000 barrels per day, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. The project was 63% complete as of February this year, according to a PetroChina statement. PetroChina did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. In May this year, state oil and gas major Sinopec (600028.SS) entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Nigerien government paving the way for further potential cooperation between Beijing and Niamey in oil and gas. In 2007, state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) (601985.SS) entered a joint venture with the Nigerien government to develop the Azelik uranium mine in the centre of the country. CNNC owns 37.2% of the project, with a further 24.8% owned by Chinese investment entity ZXJOY Invest, according to a 2010 filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Nigerien government received a 650 million yuan ($90.93 million) loan from Chinese state-owned Eximbank to support development of the project in 2009. The mine has estimated total reserves of 11,227 metric tons, and annual production capacity of 700 tons, according to the filing. The project was halted in 2015 due to unfavourable market conditions. Niger, which has Africa's highest-grade uranium ores, produced 2,020 metric tons of uranium in 2022, about 5% of world mining output, according to the World Nuclear Association.

Goldman analysts estimate global oil demand climbed to an all-time high of 102.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in July and see solid demand driving a larger-than-expected 1.8 million bpd deficit in the second half this year and a 0.6 million bpd deficit in 2024. A reduced recession risk and a strong effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to push up prices support Goldman's view on higher oil prices and an outlook for less volatility, the analysts wrote in a note. Oil prices hovered near three-month highs on Monday, set to post their biggest monthly gains in over a year on expectations that Saudi Arabia would extend voluntary output cuts into September and tighten global supply. Saudi supply cuts have brought back deficits, the Goldman analysts said, adding that they see the extra 1 million bpd Saudi cut to last through September and be halved from October.

crude oil,Oil inventory drops set stage for higher prices,"July 31, 2023",https://reuters.com/business/energy/oil-inventory-drops-set-stage-higher-prices-2023-07-31/,"LONDON/HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, July 31 (Reuters) - Oil inventories are beginning to fall in some regions as demand outpaces supply constrained by deep production cuts from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, providing support for prices which are expected to rise in coming months. JP Morgan analysts said this month that oil inventories - which include crude and fuel products - now play a bigger role in determining oil prices than the U.S. dollar because Western sanctions on Russia have accelerated oil trading in other currencies. ""We expect stocks to draw relatively aggressively in July, and by the end of August, we should be through the stock builds that we saw in the first half of the year,"" said Christopher Haines, an analyst at Energy Aspects. ""We are on the cusp of supply tightness. Saudi cuts are essentially accelerating the timeline."" Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) expect oil demand to outpace supply this year, leading to overall inventory draws to the tune of 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), mostly accounted for by the second half of the year. Although global oil inventories increased in May to their highest since September 2021, according to the IEA, driven by a substantial rise in non-OECD countries, analysts say signs of tightness are appearing, in the United States in particular. Stock declines have been geographically uneven so far, with inventory falls in the United States and Europe offset by increases in China and Japan. The declines have also been skewed more towards fuel than crude, although the supply of sour crude, typically priced lower than sweet crude, has tightened because of the cuts introduced by OPEC and its allies. ""It appears that the voluntary cuts announced by eight OPEC+ countries in April plus the additional 1 million bpd of unilateral Saudi cut that just started in July are having the desired effect, with sour barrels becoming more scarce,"" the JP Morgan analysts said. Refineries running harder to meet rising summer demand as people drive and fly more partly explains the fall in inventories, the bank said, along with a drop in Russian oil exports this month. The bank expects benchmark Brent prices , which traded around a three-month high of $84 a barrel this week, to rise to $86 a barrel by the end of the third quarter, before easing in the fourth quarter as inventories start to build again. UBS said it expected a rise to $85-$90 a barrel over coming months. Crude stocks at the Cushing storage hub in Oklahoma fell by 2.9 million barrels in the week to July 14, the steepest draw in more than a year and a half according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and shed a further 2.6 million barrels the following week, leaving them well below their five-year average. For fuel, data from consultancy FGE Energy on key hubs in the United States, northern Europe, Japan, Singapore and Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, shows that overall stocks have been drawing aggressively so far this month, both onshore and at sea. Weekly stocks of diesel, jet fuel and fuel oil in the five regions are also currently below their five-year averages. U.S. gasoline stocks of 217.6 million barrels are at their lowest level for the time of year since 2015, according to EIA data, and 5 million barrels, or 5%, lower than the prior 10-year seasonal average. Big crude builds in China and Japan have so far offset a drop in the Mideast Gulf, meaning there is no sign yet of an overall global onshore crude inventory drawdown, according to satellite analytics firm Kayrros. In fact, data from the firm shows that crude inventories in the week to July 20 reached a two-year high, with the world adding 200 million barrels into storage since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This amounts to roughly 400,000 bpd over that time period, the daily oil consumption of Portugal. China accounts for the lion's share of the gains, adding 700,000 bpd since mid-April, which Kayrros co-founder Antoine Halff noted was commercial rather than strategic. He attributed the build to weak Chinese industrial activity and the import of discounted crude from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. Crude inventories in Japan have added 25 million barrels, or 8%, since April to stand at their highest in nearly two years, according to Kayrros. China's diesel inventories also rose sharply over Nov. 2022-Feb. 2023 and have remained at elevated levels since. Crude stocks in the Mideast Gulf and North Africa region have declined by 5 million barrels overall so far this year, according to estimates by Macquarie, although OPEC members in the region have drawn 10 million barrels. ""I think Iranian barrels, both floating and onshore, had been making their way through different parts of Asia...and then ending up in China,"" said Macquarie analyst Vikas Dwivedi about what could be driving the draw. Like JP Morgan, Dwivedi believes inventories will fall in coming weeks before starting to build again in the fourth quarter as refineries slow throughput and higher oil prices drive some OPEC+ members to exceed their production quota to maximise revenue. ""We're bullish right now. This is the first time we've been bullish for a long, long time. Over about 18 months we've been bearish,"" he said.",2023-08-01 11:36:32.597203,"
Oil inventories are beginning to fall in some regions as demand outpaces supply constrained by deep production cuts from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, providing support for prices which are expected to rise in coming months.
Analysts say signs of tightness are appearing, in the United States in particular.
Stock declines have been geographically uneven so far, with inventory falls in the United States and Europe offset by increases in China and Japan.
The bank expects benchmark Brent prices , which traded around a three-month high of $84 a barrel this week, to rise to $86","[oil, crude, inventory, price, stock]"
biofuel,Explainer: What is carbon capture and storage and will it cut emissions?,"July 31, 2023",https://reuters.com/sustainability/what-is-carbon-capture-storage-will-it-cut-emissions-2023-07-31/,"LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - The UK government on Monday reaffirmed its support for projects to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions as part of its efforts to reach net zero goals and said two more projects would be able to begin negotiations to take them forward. Britain already said in March it would invest 20 billion pounds ($25.7 billion) over the next 20 years in the technology and did not announce any extra cash on Monday. There are two main types of carbon capture and storage. Point-source carbon capture and storage (CCS) which captures CO2 produced at the source, such as a smokestack, while direct air capture (DAC) removes carbon dioxide (CO2) that has already been released into the atmosphere. The two new British projects to get government backing are Acorn - developed by Storegga, Shell, Harbour Energy and North Sea Midstream Partners - and the Viking project - led by Harbour Energy. They are both designed to capture emissions from heavy-emitting sectors, such as oil and gas refining and steel manufacturing, and store them underground off the coast of Britain in depleted oil and gas fields. Firstly, the CO2 has to be separated from other gases produced in industrial processes or during power generation. Once captured it has to be compressed and transported to sites for storage often via pipelines. After that, it has to be injected into rock formations underground - typically 1 km (0.62 mile) or more under the ground - for storage for decades. CCS has been in operation since the 1970s with more than 200 million tonnes of CO2 captured and stored deep underground globally, the Global CCS Institute says. Many projects however have failed to deliver the carbon savings promised. The world's largest commercial CCS project, Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) Gorgon project in Australia has struggled to hit capacity. A U.N. panel of scientists' report last year said CCS can help the world to reach global climate targets set under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, but that the focus needed to remain on preventing emissions from being emitted in the first place. Countries such as Britain expect the technology to help them reach their net zero targets, with Britain aiming to capture and store 20-30 million tonnes a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15 million cars. Some environmental groups, however, question how effectively CCS can curb emissions as the technology enables fossil fuel companies to operate for longer and can allow more oil and gas to be recovered from old fields. According to the Global CCS Institute, 61 facilities were added to the global project pipeline last year, bringing the total to more than 190. Of those, 30 were in operation, 11 were under construction and the remainder in various stages of development. CCUS - instead of just storing the CO2 - re-uses it in industrial processes such as plastics, concrete or biofuel manufacture. CCS technology is expensive and two thirds of lifetime costs are upfront expenditure, consultancy Wood Mackenzie says. Developers have blamed a lack of funding and the absence of a clear economic argument for building CCS projects for a global lack of progress. Individual project costs vary from $20/tonne of CO2 to $150/tonne depending on the technology type and source of captured emissions, Wood Mackenzie said in a 2022 report. It forecast costs could fall by 20%-25% over the next two decades. CCS with direct air capture is in the high triple digits per tonne, depending on the technology type.

The deal discussions come amid a supply crunch for lithium. Sigma earlier this year started production at the Grota do Cirilo hard rock lithium project in Brazil to supply roughly a fourth of its output to LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) with the rest slated for sale on the spot market. Bank of America has been Sigma's bank on retainer for some time and has been holding meetings for at least four months with parties that approach with interest in acquiring the lithium miner, Sigma CEO Ana Cabral-Gardner said in an interview. She added that the company ""is focused on alternatives that embrace the importance of our shareholders' values of social sustainability."" Bank of America declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported in February, citing sources, that automaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) was considering a bid for Vancouver-based Sigma, which is listed on Nasdaq and has a market value of $4.2 billion. ""What I can confirm is that since the rumors started in February, the management continues to work to understand strategic alternatives to strengthen Sigma's and Brazil's unique environmentally competitive position on the midstream of the global supply chain,"" said Cabral-Gardner. She is also managing partner of A10 Investimentos, which owns 44% of Sigma's shares. Cabral-Gardner said that while Bank of America is coordinating meetings with parties that approach Sigma, Sigma has not yet picked a bank to advise on any potential transaction. ""Maybe I'm not selling. Maybe I'm partnering with someone. I don't know what I'm doing yet,"" Cabral-Gardner said in the interview. ""We need to find someone to marry, and when we find someone to marry, then we choose a priest,"" Cabral-Gardner said, making an analogy between an M&A banker and a priest. ""The priest is going to depend on who we're going to marry."" Cabral-Gardner added that Sigma does not plan to sell the Brazilian mine separately from the company itself. ""The company is the asset,"" she said. Because lithium demand is low in biofuel-focused Brazil, the country exports nearly all of it. Sigma has projected the mine will reach annual free cash flow of $455 million for its first phase of production.

It also clarifies that red flags were found in previous audits and adds the ISCC statement on policy to not give details of reasons for suspending certification.) Auditors suspended the sustainable fuel certification of three Chinese biofuel exporters after flagging potential issues with the sourcing of waste oil from Malaysia and Indonesia. Germany last month triggered a European Union investigation into a large volume of biofuels imports into Europe from China to assess whether the fuel meets EU sustainability criteria. The Germany-based International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) company, which oversees certification of fuel as sustainable, listed the three companies as having their sustainable certification suspended in its online database. The companies suspended were Hainan Hanpu Import and Export Trade, Hainan Bomi Import and Export Trading and Wuchuan Maosheng Bio-energy. The two Hainan-island based companies had their certification suspended in June and remain suspended. Wuchuan Maoshing had a one-month suspension that was lifted at the end of May, according to the database. The suspensions, which had not previously been reported, meant the companies could not export biofuel to the European Union. The ISCC declined to give more detail on the reasons for the suspensions when requested by Reuters. It said that as a policy it ""can and will not publish specific reasons for the suspension and withdrawal of a certificate."" Previous audit reports, however, cited the companies' inaccuracy of records, lack of traceability of sustainable materials and mislabeling of raw materials as potential risk factors for sustainability certification. The three Chinese companies and their ISCC-registered auditors - TÜV Nord, RINA and the China Quality Certification Centre - did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. EU incentives for biodiesel production made with waste oils and fat to increase renewable energy use have encouraged companies in Asia to mix biofuels with cheaper oils, especially palm oil and export them to Europe, according to top European industry body EWABA. The European Waste-based & Advanced Biofuels Association warned last month that a flood of potentially ""dubious or fraudulent"" biodiesel imports into Europe from China could trigger the collapse of the EU's biofuels industry. Audit documents for the three suspended firms listed their raw materials as coming in part from palm oil from Indonesia or Malaysia. Palm oil from the two countries is subject to steep European import duties because the EU does not classify palm oil as sustainable. The Yangpu-based firms are among the largest biofuel blenders on Hainan Island, while the mainland-based company trades in biofuel with those companies, two European trade sources said.",2023-08-01 11:36:32.597203,"

The 26 billion euro Finnish energy major, the world’s biggest biofuel maker by capacity, reported on Thursday a 24% fall in half-year revenue while also announcing delays to its ambitious plan to ramp up production of sustainable fuels in Singapore. That rattled investors’ confidence, triggering a 15% drop in its stock. Neste’s production woes are a big headache for Chief Executive Matti Lehmus but also for the aviation sector. The 1.6 billion euro construction of the Singapore Expansion Project - which started at the beginning of 2019 - was expected to add 2.6 million tons of fuel capacity per annum. That includes up to 1 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is key to make planes greener as it cuts carbon emissions by up to 80%. But the rollout of the facility has suffered delays due to equipment repairs and maintenance shutdowns. Neste is now predicting that it will produce 230,000 tons less of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel in the second half of 2023. That’s bad news for the fight against climate change. The industry has made little progress in reducing polluting emissions from jets and planes. Neste's production problems will further complicate the aviation race to net zero.

biofuel,Robin Hood tariff could curb airline emissions,"July 24, 2023",https://reuters.com/breakingviews/robin-hood-tariff-could-curb-airline-emissions-2023-07-24/,"TINOS, GREECE, July 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Some readers, especially those in the northern hemisphere, may be feeling “flight shame” this summer. How can they justify jetting on holiday when temperatures are soaring across Europe, America and China? I am acutely aware of this, working from home in Greece where forest fires have been raging. Guilt is useful if it provokes action. In this case, the main solution is not for individuals to stop flying voluntarily. It is to transform the airline industry so that it doesn’t fry the planet. A key part would be to tax aviation fuel, with the richest countries and the most frequent flyers bearing the biggest burden. Aviation isn’t the planet’s biggest polluter. Nevertheless, aircraft are responsible for about 4% of global warming from carbon emissions and the vapour trails they leave behind in the sky. What’s more, the industry is growing fast. Without evasive action, it will contribute an even bigger portion of future increases in the global temperature. New types of planes powered by electric batteries or hydrogen would help. But they won’t be able to do much of the job until the middle of the century. A more viable short-term option is to run planes on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Even so the cheapest of these, biofuel, still costs about two to three times as much as kerosene, the traditional jet fuel. Biofuel uses things like cooking oil waste as its feedstock. But it’s not possible to scale it up to replace all jet fuel. Synthetic fuel, such as e-kerosene made from green hydrogen, doesn’t suffer from that problem. But it is even more expensive, costing seven to ten times the price of conventional jet fuel. The process of creating green hydrogen by electrolysing water with renewable energy and then combining it with carbon dioxide is also inherently complex. As fuel accounts for around 30% of airlines’ costs the industry isn’t going to use much SAF voluntarily. There are three ways to get the industry to switch. The first is to subsidise sustainable fuels, as the U.S. government is doing with its SAF Grand Challenge to support research, development and early deployment of new technologies. That could help kickstart the industry. But synthetic fuels will still probably be 1.5-2.5 times the price of traditional fuels by the middle of the century. Even rich governments won’t keep bridging the gap with subsidies for several decades. A second solution is to force airlines to use SAF. The European Union, for example, is requiring 6% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF by 2030; 1.2% of the fuel must be synthetic. But these are still small quantities. The third option is to tax either the kerosene that airlines burn or the emissions they spew out into the atmosphere. This would push up the price of conventional fuel, narrowing the gap with SAF. So far only the EU, United Kingdom and some smaller countries are doing this via emissions trading schemes (ETS). These require airlines to get permits for every tonne of carbon they emit on flights within Europe. These currently cost about 90 euros per tonne. But even the EU’s efforts are limited. Back in 2012 the bloc wanted to include flights leaving Europe in the scheme but backed down when countries including China and the United States objected. This is one reason that the EU is under-taxing the airline industry by 26 billion euros a year, according to the non-profit group Transport and Environment. The world’s governments could, in theory, impose a global tax on kerosene via the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United Nations agency that regulates the industry. They started such a process to tax shipping emissions via that industry’s equivalent UN agency earlier this month. But so far there’s little momentum to adopt a similar approach to airlines. French President Emmanuel Macron is one of the few leaders calling for a global tax. There are multiple blockages. One is that the United States hasn’t yet imposed carbon taxes on any industry. Another is that developing countries don’t see why their airlines should pay up for emissions when their populations don’t fly much and have contributed relatively little to climate damage. The ICAO has agreed a carbon offset scheme, which takes full effect in 2027. This requires airlines to compensate for the carbon they emit above recent levels by putting money into projects that cut emissions in other industries. But this is unlikely to make much difference, not least because the price of offsets is expected to be a fraction of the cost of the EU’s ETS permits. The ICAO did last year agree on an “aspirational” long-term goal of cutting the industry’s emissions to zero by 2050 on a net basis. If governments are serious, they will need a plan to hit this target. To work, the plan would need to channel Robin Hood, the legendary English outlaw who stole from the rich to give to the poor. Airlines operating in wealthy countries will either have to pay higher taxes than their rivals in less-developed parts of the world, or rich governments will need to give a big chunk of the taxes they raise to poor countries. Another possibility is for those passengers who fly the most, the bulk of whom are in rich countries, to pay a “frequent flyer levy” which rises the more often they travel by air. The International Council on Clean Transportation has proposed a plan to raise $121 billion a year with such a scheme. The levy would be set at zero for a traveller’s first flight in a year, rising to $177 for their twentieth trip. Rich countries might baulk. But they should realise that taxing kerosene would not only narrow the gap with more sustainable fuels, but would also provide revenue to fund subsidies to close it further. What’s more, it’s worth the developed world giving some of this money to poor countries as part of a global deal rather than putting its own aviation industry at a competitive disadvantage. Cracking this problem will be a long haul. Readers who feel flight shame could start by making it clear they would be happy to pay higher levies the more they fly.

Refiners including Par Pacific Holdings Inc (PARR.N) plan to join together in a legal challenge against the decision, a Par Pacific spokesperson told Reuters. ""We believe EPA's decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law,"" said Ashimi Patel with Par Pacific. Par Pacific and CVR Energy (CVI.N) have some of the largest outstanding obligations. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix or buy credits - known as RINs - from those that do. The EPA can, however, award exemptions to some small refiners if they prove that the obligations cause them undue harm. ""We will continue to fight for our rights that we believe Wynnewood (Oklahoma refinery) is entitled to,"" CVR Energy Chief Executive David Lamp said during the company's first quarter earnings call in May, before the EPA's decision last week. Par Pacific's gross RINs and environmental credit obligations stood at $347 million at the end of the first quarter 2023, based on market pricing then, a company filing showed. CVR Energy's outstanding liability was about $582 million at the end of the first quarter, another filing showed. As the EPA under President Joe Biden has not granted any refiner an exemption, the EPA's decision last week was not a surprise, Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co's Matthew Blair said in a note on Monday. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM)refiner trade group assailed the EPA's broad rejections. ""Congress understood from the get-go that RFS compliance could impose a disproportionate financial burden on small refineries,"" said AFPM spokesperson Ericka Perryman.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has the authority to issue the exemptions, denied 26 petitions from 15 small refineries who applied for waivers for the 2016-2018 and 2021-2023 compliance years, the agency said on Friday. There are still two pending petitions. The agency also disclosed which oil refiners submitted petitions in July 2022 or later, as well as which oil refiners are participating in an alternative compliance schedule that allows them flexibility in complying with biofuel blending laws. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. The EPA can, however, award exemptions to some small refiners if they prove that the obligations cause them undue harm. Biden has been trying to set the United States on track to reduce carbon emissions in the fight against climate change, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The administration has not yet extended a waiver to any refinery, reversing the policy of former President Donald Trump, whose administration granted 34 exemptions to oil refiners for the 2017 compliance year alone. The EPA consulted with the Department of Energy on Friday's waiver decisions and found that none of the petitioning small refineries demonstrated they face disproportionate economic hardship caused by their RFS compliance, the agency said. The EPA publicized on Friday the names of refiners that submitted small-refinery exemption petitions from July 2022 or later. The agency added this information to its website to reflect its commitment to transparency around RFS decisions, it said. Refiners that submitted petitions included Calumet Montana Refining and Ergon Refining. Their petitions were denied. The agency also publicized the names of refiners that are using an alternative schedule to prove RFS compliance. Among those listed were Sinclair Wyoming Refining Company and Kern Oil and Refining Company. Data from the EPA showed 17 small refineries have opted into the alternative compliance schedule for the 2020 compliance year, the only compliance year shown in the data.

biofuel,US lawmakers seek to lower biofuel blending compliance costs,"July 13, 2023",https://reuters.com/business/energy/us-lawmakers-seek-lower-biofuel-blending-compliance-costs-2023-07-12/,"NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation this week directing the Biden administration to allow oil refiners to purchase compliance credits for U.S. biofuel blending laws at a lower, fixed cost compared to the open market. The proposal would reduce rising compliance costs associated with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and aim to help struggling refineries stay afloat at a time of great flux in the global energy markets, lawmakers said. As part of the standard, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. Oil refiners argue the mandates are pricey, while biofuel proponents like ethanol producers and corn farmers like the obligations because it increases the market for their products. Under the proposed bill, refiners could buy credits around conventional biofuel blending, which includes corn-based ethanol blending, at the fixed price if they are not able to obtain them in the market at cost-effective levels, according to a news release. News of the bill caused prices for the credits, known as RINs, to dip. ""We can and must do more to address volatile and soaring compliance costs driven by fuel mandates that are out of step with domestic fuel demand,” said Chris Coons, who introduced the bill along with fellow Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican U.S. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick. It is unclear whether the measure, unveiled on Tuesday, will pass. Issues around the RFS typically draw strong lobbying efforts from both oil refining advocates and biofuel advocates. The bill must pass both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House of Representatives before it could reach President Joe Biden's desk, who would decide whether to sign it into law. Renewable fuel credits traded at $1.54 each on Tuesday after the bill came out, down from $1.56 prior, traders said.

According to the report Asia Biofuel Outlook, produced by research firm BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, India's pursuit of increased ethanol blending in gasoline, as a way to cut the oil products' import bill and reduce carbon emissions, will continue to support global sugar prices. BMI says that there is currently a fast development of additional capacity to produce ethanol in India, where the biofuel is made mainly from sugarcane. As more ethanol plants start production, more of the country's sugarcane crop will be used to make the fuel, limiting the amount of sugar that will be produced. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), India's ethanol blending has reached 11.5%, while the country's government target is to reach 20% by 2025. The report said that although it is ""doubtful"" that India will be able to achieve that by 2025, the program will cap exports of feedstocks used in ethanol production. BMI noted that Indonesia is also getting back to an ethanol blending program with a 5% rate initially, and a target to get to 10% by 2030. The research firm said that the country would need to sharply increase sugarcane planting to reach that target, and it would probably need to import ethanol to do it.

""The assessment on the windfall tax is a matter for the finance minister, and it is also related also to the (guidelines of the) European Union,"" minister Pichetto Fratin said. ""It is clear that, with a view to achieving a normalisation, we all hope there should be no tax (on 2023 profits),"" he added, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of the Italian industrial lobby for energy. Rome expects to collect this year more than 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion) through a one-off windfall tax calculated on the part of 2022 corporate income which is at least 10% higher than the average income reported between 2018 and 2021. The scheme replaced a similar levy in force last year which has triggered criticism and refusals to pay from multiple firms. Attending the same event, Edison CEO Nicola Monti said the 2022 levy had increased the tax rate on the group to 72%, a level he labelled as unacceptable. The energy minister said that Italy had sent a list of projects to tap European Union funds under the REPowerEU scheme, adding that a decision by Brussels over which investments to fund was expected by August. The list of projects sent to the European Commission does not include an additional floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, the minister said but refrained from mentioning other proposals. A project for carbon capture and storage led by energy group Eni (ENI.MI) and gas grid group Snam (SRG.MI) has been included in the list of proposals, senior Eni executive Guido Brusco said. REPowerEU is designed to cut consumption, help diversify supply and enable the shift to cleaner energy. Brusco, who heads Eni's exploration and production (E&P)business, was appointed as chairman of the Italian industrial lobby for the energy sector on Friday, succeeding Giuseppe Ricci, Eni's chief for biofuel and sustainable mobility business.

Chacraservicios, which is focused on the cultivation of Camelina sativa, a crop with high oil content, will contribute to Bunge and Chevron's global supply chains by adding a new oil source to meet the growing demand for lower carbon renewable feedstocks, the companies said. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Renewable diesel emits lesser emissions by roughly 4.2% for carbon dioxide from the same volume of regular diesel, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, when compared with both biodiesel and regular diesel. That makes it attractive to logistics firms and other companies seeking to lower their supply chain pollution levels. Expanding production of renewable diesel depends on increasing the supply of oils made from crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday cut its estimate of how many acres of soybeans, a key source of vegetable oil, had been planted. Bunge has in the past two years entered partnerships with Chevron to crush oilseeds for renewable diesel, and with seedmaker Corteva (CTVA.N) to tailor crops for biofuel feedstocks.

However, selling in corn may have been revived late last week on a highly bearish U.S. supply outlook. Chicago corn, wheat, soybean and soybean meal futures began rallying sharply in mid-June as expanding U.S. drought and disappointing rain events hammered crop conditions. Corn, soybeans and meal topped on June 21 but eased significantly in the following sessions on improved weather forecasts. In the week ended June 27, money managers cut their net long in CBOT corn futures and options to 52,845 contracts from 58,299 a week earlier, which included reductions in both long and shorts. Trade sources had pegged the week’s net corn selling to be about four times heavier. December corn futures fell 6.1% in the week ended June 27 but had been up as much as 5.4% on June 21. The contract fell almost 12% between Wednesday and Friday, settling at $4.94-3/4 per bushel, the lowest since October 2021 and off 21% from the June 21 peak. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday revealed U.S. farmers had planted far more corn acres than analysts expected, amplifying the corn sell-off that has been mostly weather-driven. Soybean acres came in far below expectations, causing November beans to jump 6% on Friday. Soybean futures shed 3.6% in the week ended June 27 after max gains of 2.6% on June 21, though money managers increased their net long to 99,480 futures and options contracts from 76,950 a week earlier, mostly on new longs but including some short covering. Modest selling had been expected. December soymeal fell 4.3% through June 27 after max gains of 7.5% on June 21, which curbed the week’s selling. Money managers reduced their meal net long to 58,980 futures and options contracts from 63,924 in the prior week, in line with expectations. CBOT wheat futures rose 0.5% in the week ended June 27, though the contract had surged as much as 10.7% by June 26. Money managers executed a second consecutive week of heavy short covering in wheat, slashing their net short to 52,168 futures and options contracts from 84,134. That marked funds’ least bearish CBOT wheat view since November, and the two weeks ended June 27 featured speculators’ heaviest spree of short covering in six years. Gross longs were slightly reduced in both weeks. Price action in CBOT soybean oil was opposite from the others, as futures eased nearly 1% in the week ended June 27 but had been down as much as 11% with traders interpreting U.S. biofuel blending mandates negatively. Money managers covered bean oil shorts and added new longs through June 27, increasing their net long to 38,751 futures and options contracts, their most bullish view since January and up from 29,817 in the prior week. CBOT November soybeans rose nearly 4% in the last three sessions and the soy products both added more than 3%, including a limit-up move for soybean oil on Friday. December soyoil’s Friday close of 58.97 cents per pound was the highest since early March. CBOT wheat fell almost 7% between Wednesday and Friday, weighed down by corn’s 12% losses. Wheat took a back seat to corn and soybeans Friday, though USDA's estimate of June 1 U.S. wheat stocks and 2023 wheat plantings came in below analyst predictions. Trade sources peg funds’ net selling in CBOT corn futures at 55,500 contracts over the last three sessions, and CBOT wheat selling is seen at 20,500 futures contracts. Funds were seen as net buyers of 8,000 soybean futures, 9,500 soyoil futures and 3,500 soymeal futures between Wednesday and Friday. Money managers’ weekly net selling in CBOT corn futures and options has twice exceeded 100,000 contracts this calendar year.

Retailers ship huge volumes of clothes from production centres in countries such as China, Vietnam and Bangladesh to consumers around the world, causing carbon dioxide emissions. Overall, the textile industry is estimated to be responsible for between 2% and 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a United Nations Environment Programme report published last month. The shipping industry, which itself aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, has begun offering low-emission fuels such as biofuels made from cooking oil and food waste or methanol produced from renewable energy as an alternative to fuel oil. The fashion industry accounted for 26% of the more than 240,000 containers that Maersk shipped last year using biofuels under its ECO Delivery contracts, making it the biggest sector using the low-emission fuel service, the company said. ""Many of the fashion brands have actually been the ones going for this,"" Josue Alzamora, global head of lifestyle vertical at Maersk, told Reuters at this week's Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen. ""Of course, fashion companies also feel the pressure from consumers,"" Alzamora said. Nearly one out of 10 containers Maersk, the number two global ocean container shipping firm, handled for owners of fashion brands last year was shipped using biofuels, he said. The ECO Delivery contracts are sold at a premium to regular shipping. Many fashion brands and other retailers are looking at how they can respond to environmental issues raised by their often young and relatively affluent client bases, with companies pledging to cut emissions and reduce climate impact. H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said in 2022 that over the past two years it had purchased eco fuel for a ""significant share"" of its ocean transports. It has stated its ambition to become ""climate positive"" by 2040. ""H&M was one of the first companies to join the journey with us for biofuel,"" Alzamora said. Retail giants including Amazon (AMZN.O) and IKEA have committed to switching fully to zero-carbon fuel shipping by 2040. Biofuels can reduce emissions in container shipping by more than 80% compared to standard fuel oil. Still, vessels running on biofuels only accounted for around 2% of Maersk's total seaborne volumes last year. Interest is also now also growing in methanol as an alternative fuel. Maersk has ordered 25 such vessels with the first delivery in September. In total, shipping companies have ordered more than 100 vessels that can operate on both fuel oil and methanol, according to Maersk. However, sourcing greener fuels such as methanol remains a challenge as the industry is still in its infancy. ""The fashion industry helps us to move the needle when it comes to getting more methanol produced,"" Alzamora said, pointing to the demand from the industry for alternatives given it is one of the biggest sectors for container shipping.",2023-08-01 11:36:32.597203,"

But other executives at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur were divided, with Malaysia state oil firm Petronas reporting a slowdown in demand for petroleum and petrochemicals in the second quarter and growing refinery capacity putting pressure on the market. ""Overall, we believe that oil market fundamentals remain generally sound for the rest of the year,"" said Nasser, who heads the world's largest oil company. ""Despite the recession risks in several OECD countries, the economies of developing countries – especially China and India – are driving healthy oil demand growth of more than 2 million barrels per day this year,"" he told the conference. Although China faces economic headwinds, the transport and petrochemical sectors are still showing signs of demand growth, he added. Brent crude futures are down about 14% since the start of the year as rising interest rates hit investor appetite, while China's promising economic recovery has faltered after several months of softer-than-expected consumption, production and property market data. Crude oil supplies from Russia and Iran have also held up despite Western sanctions, offsetting production cuts by Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). While a failed mutiny by mercenaries in Russia over the weekend has raised concerns about political instability and pushed up oil prices, none of the industry executives and officials speaking on the first day of the conference mentioned it during their onstage remarks. ""There's not much geopolitical impact on the market now. It is dominated by economics, not geopolitics,"" Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global, said on the sidelines of the event. Russell Hardy, CEO of Vitol, the largest independent oil trader, said the industry probably faces a period of reasonably strong fundamentals in the next three or four months, but uncertainty with Russian supply and Chinese demand make it more difficult to forecast market balances and where prices are going. ""What has happened so far this year is the supply side has slightly overperformed, particularly Russia, where there were expectations of production loss as a result of the difficulty getting oil to market because of the sanctions,"" he said. Sazali Hamzah, Petronas' executive vice president and CEO of downstream, was less optimistic, saying that demand for petroleum and petrochemicals started slowing in the second quarter despite a recovery in jet fuel consumption. He expects new refining capacity coming online this year to put ""a lot of pressure on the market"". ""We believe in second-half of this year we will still see weak demand, and that will be extended to part of next year,"" he added.
