crude oil,Oil on track for biggest monthly gains in over a year,"July 31, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-track-biggest-monthly-gains-over-year-2023-07-31/,"LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices were set to post their biggest monthly gains in more than a year on Monday, on expectations that Saudi Arabia will extend voluntary output cuts into September and tighten global supply. Brent crude futures rose 60 cents higher to $85.59 a barrel by 1159 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 73 cents to $81.31 a barrel. The September Brent contract will expire on Monday. The more active October contract was 62 cents higher at $85.03 a barrel. Brent and WTI settled on Friday at their highest levels since April, gaining for a fifth straight week, as tightening oil supplies globally and expectations of an end to U.S. interest rate hikes supported prices. Both are on track to close July with their biggest monthly gains since January 2022. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is expected to extend a voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include September. ""There is bull-twitch in the market’s antenna, something which Saudi will most definitely look to aggravate with a roll in their production cut,"" said PVM analyst John Evans. ""Oil will again enjoy a beginning of the month firmness that it has done for the last three cycles before global economic news comes to keep it in check,"" he added. Riyadh's existing cuts have already constrained supplies, with oil inventories beginning to fall in some regions - the United States in particular - as demand outpaces supply. ""Oil prices are up 18% since mid-June as record high demand and Saudi supply cuts have brought back deficits, and as the market has abandoned its growth pessimism,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a July 30 note. The bank estimated that global oil demand rose to a record 102.8 million bpd in July and it revised up 2023 demand by about 550,000 bpd on stronger economic growth estimates in India and the U.S., offsetting a downgrade for China's consumption. However, a Reuters poll of 37 economists and analysts on Monday forecast oil prices to stall this year as high interest rates curb demand, offsetting the impact of OPEC+ production cuts on supply. The survey predicted front month Brent oil would average $81.95 a barrel in 2023, down from June's $83.03 consensus and current levels of around $85.","

crude oil,US futures inch up; stock markets ride higher on cooler inflation,"July 31, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-pix-2023-07-31/,"LONDON July 31  (Reuters) - U.S. share futures treaded cautiously higher on Monday ahead of more large-cap earnings reports, central bank meetings and a key employment report due later this week. US stock futures were mixed at 1100 GMT with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 both up about 0.1%. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) both report on Thursday, while other well-known names with results due include Western Digital Corp (WDC.O), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O). U.S. futures were unenthused by a jump in European shares after euro zone inflation fell further in July seeing that most measures of underlying price growth also eased. Markets took this as a comforting sign for the European Central Bank (ECB) as it considers ending a brutal string of interest rate hikes. Germany's blue-chip stocks index hit a record high at one point and was last up 0.1% (.GDAXI). The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose by 0.2%, heading for a second consecutive monthly gain. This lightened the mood in markets after China's manufacturing activity fell for a fourth straight month in July, as demand remained weak at home and abroad, official surveys showed on Monday. ""Markets are treating information with a lot more sensitivity and people are looking into new information with a detailed eye,"" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Within the detail of the Euro zone report, Deutsche Bank's senior European analyst Marc de Muizon noted how service prices were resilient in the region but not as strong as they should be at the height of the 2023 tourism season. ""The apparent strength of the headline quarterly growth was driven by a few country idiosyncrasies and masks an underlying momentum that is likely much closer to stagnation,"" de Muizon said. Figures hotly anticipated this week include the U.S. ISM surveys on manufacturing and services, as well as the July payrolls report. All three main U.S. indexes ended last week higher and appear set to gain this month as signs of cooling inflation and a resilient economy have eased investor sentiment about the economy surviving amid higher rates for longer. Upbeat quarterly earnings from megacap growth companies including Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms (META.O) as well as chipmakers Intel (INTC.O) and Lam Research (LRCX.O) have also boosted investor sentiment. Almost 30% of the S&P 500 report results this week and so far earnings have been good enough to see the index extend its rally to 10% since the start of June. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) logged in July its longest winning streak in nearly four-decades underpinned by gains in sectors including healthcare, financials and energy that had underperformed during the first half of the year. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise rates by at least a quarter point, but markets are more divided on whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will hike or stay on hold. Traders cut bets on a continuing rally in the pound by the most since mid-June ahead of the Bank of England rate decision on Thursday. Sterling has surged 24% from a record low of $1.033 against the dollar in September after a disastrous budget, hitting a 15-month high of $1.314 in mid-July. The euro gained, up 0.1% to $1.103, as did the dollar index , staying largely flat at 101.660. Investors continued to digest Friday's decision by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lift the lid on bond yields, in a step away from its ultra-easy policies. Analysts at BofA estimate the BOJ's bond buying added $1.3 trillion to global liquidity in the past 18 months and provided a low floor for global rates, so any sustained rise in Japanese government bond yields could ripple though other bond markets. Japanese 10-year yields surged to a nine-year high up to 0.6% on Monday, and toward the new cap of 1.0%. That also put upward pressure on Treasury yields, where the 10-year rose 1 basis point to 3.97%. In commodities, gold traded flat at $1,960 an ounce , but still higher for the month so far. Dropping oil inventories pushed Brent 58 cents higher from Friday's close to $85.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 70 cents to $81.26.","The five most important keywords in the article are:

crude oil,"Analysis: Pakistan's imports of Russian crude face port, refinery, currency constraints","July 31, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/commodities/pakistans-imports-russian-crude-face-port-refinery-currency-constraints-2023-07-31/,"KARACHI, Pakistan, July 31 (Reuters) - Pakistan is unlikely to meet a target for Russian crude to make up two-thirds of its oil imports, despite attractive prices, hampered by a shortage of foreign currency and limitations at its refineries and ports, officials and analysts say. The cash-strapped South Asian nation became Russia's latest customer snapping up discounted crude that has been banned from European markets due to Russia's war on Ukraine. Its first cargo arrived in June and a second is now under negotiation. It is targeting 100,000 bpd of imports from Russia, compared with the total 154,000 bpd of crude it imported in 2022, in the hopes that will lower its import bill, address a foreign exchange crisis and keep a lid on record high inflation. However, the benefits are being offset by increased shipping costs and lower quality refined products compared with the fuels produced with crude from Pakistan's main suppliers, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan will have to increase gasoline and gasoil imports to make up for the lower output of these fuels from the Russian crude, leading to more dollar outflows and stress on its crisis-hit economy, said Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at Pakistan-based FRIM Ventures. While Islamabad and Moscow have not disclosed pricing details and the extent of discounts, a shortage of Chinese yuan currency to pay for Russian crude poses another hurdle, as it needs the yuan for trade with China, its top trade partner. Pakistan paid for its first Russian crude cargo in Chinese yuan. However, Aadil Nakhoda, assistant professor at Karachi's Institute of Business Administration, said it would be better for the country to use a barter deal with Russia than paying with yuan, which traders say is in short supply. ""How will it pay other lenders and how will it finance trade with China if it uses the low yuan reserves to pay for Russian oil?"" Nakhoda said. Adding to the challenges, transportation costs for Russian crude are higher than for Middle Eastern crudes not only because of the longer distance traveled, but because Pakistan's ports cannot handle the large vessels departing Russia. Urals crude had to be transferred from a supertanker on to smaller ships, known as a lightering operation, in Oman before heading to Pakistan, government officials said, unlike direct shipments from the Middle East. Even with that extra cost, it was worth importing Russian oil, said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler, as Saudi Arab Light crude is $10 to $11 per barrel more expensive for Pakistani refiners than Urals, while lightering operations add around $2 to $3 per barrel. ""Pakistani buyers would still be much better off,"" he said. However, Urals quality is a deterrent, as Pakistan's refineries cannot get as much gasoline and diesel out of Urals crude as they produce from Saudi and UAE crudes. It will take Pakistan Refinery Ltd (PRL) at least two months to fully process its first cargo of 100,000 metric tons (730,000 barrels) of Urals crude as it needs to be blended with Middle East crude to offset the high output of fuel oil from the Russian oil, Zahid Mir, chief executive of the state-run refiner, told Reuters. ""Our optimum processing solution is to blend Urals with Middle Eastern imported crude while not exceeding 50% Ural in the blend,"" Mir said. The residual fuel produced from Urals crude has to be mixed with diesel and kerosene to meet specifications for local use while the remainder is exported, but the deal was still commercially viable for Pakistan, Mir said. PRL has no plans to upgrade its refinery to process fuel oil into higher quality fuels, he added. Kpler's Katona expects Pakistan's liquidity issues and technical challenges to weigh on its appetite for Russian crude. ""Russian imports into Pakistan will not grow into anything bigger than one cargo per month,"" he said.","

Since last week's coup, in which military leaders detained Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum and established a military government, China says it is closely monitoring the situation, and urges parties in Niger to safeguard stability. China's total foreign direct investment (FDI) into Niger stood at $2.68 billion as at the end of 2020, according to the U.S. Embassy in Niger. Following are China's main investments in Niger, predominantly by state energy giant PetroChina and national nuclear firm CNNC: Niger became an oil producer in 2011 when the Agadem oilfield, a joint venture between the government and PetroChina (601857.SS), started production. PetroChina entered a production sharing agreement in 2008 with the Nigerien government to develop the field, located some 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of the capital Niamey, with estimated reserves of 650 million barrels. As part of the deal, PetroChina invested in the construction of the SORAZ refinery, located 460km away in the southern city of Zinder, near the border with Nigeria. PetroChina holds a 60% stake in the refinery, which has a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) and mostly supplies the Nigerien domestic fuel market. The remaining share is held by the Nigerien government. In September 2019, PetroChina entered into another agreement with the Nigerien government to lay a 2,000-km (1,200 miles) pipeline between the Agadem field and the Beninese port city of Cotonou. The pipeline investment is twinned with a second phase of development of the Agadem field. Taken together, total investment into the pipeline and second phase development is expected to reach $4 billion, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. The pipeline, the longest of its kind in Africa, is planned to mitigate the security and logistical challenges of exporting crude from the troubled area, and designed to carry 90,000 barrels per day, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. The project was 63% complete as of February this year, according to a PetroChina statement. PetroChina did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. In May this year, state oil and gas major Sinopec (600028.SS) entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Nigerien government paving the way for further potential cooperation between Beijing and Niamey in oil and gas. In 2007, state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) (601985.SS) entered a joint venture with the Nigerien government to develop the Azelik uranium mine in the centre of the country. CNNC owns 37.2% of the project, with a further 24.8% owned by Chinese investment entity ZXJOY Invest, according to a 2010 filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Nigerien government received a 650 million yuan ($90.93 million) loan from Chinese state-owned Eximbank to support development of the project in 2009. The mine has estimated total reserves of 11,227 metric tons, and annual production capacity of 700 tons, according to the filing. The project was halted in 2015 due to unfavourable market conditions. Niger, which has Africa's highest-grade uranium ores, produced 2,020 metric tons of uranium in 2022, about 5% of world mining output, according to the World Nuclear Association.

crude oil,Oil inventory drops set stage for higher prices,"July 31, 2023",https://reuters.com/business/energy/oil-inventory-drops-set-stage-higher-prices-2023-07-31/,"LONDON/HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, July 31 (Reuters) - Oil inventories are beginning to fall in some regions as demand outpaces supply constrained by deep production cuts from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, providing support for prices which are expected to rise in coming months. JP Morgan analysts said this month that oil inventories - which include crude and fuel products - now play a bigger role in determining oil prices than the U.S. dollar because Western sanctions on Russia have accelerated oil trading in other currencies. ""We expect stocks to draw relatively aggressively in July, and by the end of August, we should be through the stock builds that we saw in the first half of the year,"" said Christopher Haines, an analyst at Energy Aspects. ""We are on the cusp of supply tightness. Saudi cuts are essentially accelerating the timeline."" Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) expect oil demand to outpace supply this year, leading to overall inventory draws to the tune of 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), mostly accounted for by the second half of the year. Although global oil inventories increased in May to their highest since September 2021, according to the IEA, driven by a substantial rise in non-OECD countries, analysts say signs of tightness are appearing, in the United States in particular. Stock declines have been geographically uneven so far, with inventory falls in the United States and Europe offset by increases in China and Japan. The declines have also been skewed more towards fuel than crude, although the supply of sour crude, typically priced lower than sweet crude, has tightened because of the cuts introduced by OPEC and its allies. ""It appears that the voluntary cuts announced by eight OPEC+ countries in April plus the additional 1 million bpd of unilateral Saudi cut that just started in July are having the desired effect, with sour barrels becoming more scarce,"" the JP Morgan analysts said. Refineries running harder to meet rising summer demand as people drive and fly more partly explains the fall in inventories, the bank said, along with a drop in Russian oil exports this month. The bank expects benchmark Brent prices , which traded around a three-month high of $84 a barrel this week, to rise to $86 a barrel by the end of the third quarter, before easing in the fourth quarter as inventories start to build again. UBS said it expected a rise to $85-$90 a barrel over coming months. Crude stocks at the Cushing storage hub in Oklahoma fell by 2.9 million barrels in the week to July 14, the steepest draw in more than a year and a half according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and shed a further 2.6 million barrels the following week, leaving them well below their five-year average. For fuel, data from consultancy FGE Energy on key hubs in the United States, northern Europe, Japan, Singapore and Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, shows that overall stocks have been drawing aggressively so far this month, both onshore and at sea. Weekly stocks of diesel, jet fuel and fuel oil in the five regions are also currently below their five-year averages. U.S. gasoline stocks of 217.6 million barrels are at their lowest level for the time of year since 2015, according to EIA data, and 5 million barrels, or 5%, lower than the prior 10-year seasonal average. Big crude builds in China and Japan have so far offset a drop in the Mideast Gulf, meaning there is no sign yet of an overall global onshore crude inventory drawdown, according to satellite analytics firm Kayrros. In fact, data from the firm shows that crude inventories in the week to July 20 reached a two-year high, with the world adding 200 million barrels into storage since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This amounts to roughly 400,000 bpd over that time period, the daily oil consumption of Portugal. China accounts for the lion's share of the gains, adding 700,000 bpd since mid-April, which Kayrros co-founder Antoine Halff noted was commercial rather than strategic. He attributed the build to weak Chinese industrial activity and the import of discounted crude from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. Crude inventories in Japan have added 25 million barrels, or 8%, since April to stand at their highest in nearly two years, according to Kayrros. China's diesel inventories also rose sharply over Nov. 2022-Feb. 2023 and have remained at elevated levels since. Crude stocks in the Mideast Gulf and North Africa region have declined by 5 million barrels overall so far this year, according to estimates by Macquarie, although OPEC members in the region have drawn 10 million barrels. ""I think Iranian barrels, both floating and onshore, had been making their way through different parts of Asia...and then ending up in China,"" said Macquarie analyst Vikas Dwivedi about what could be driving the draw. Like JP Morgan, Dwivedi believes inventories will fall in coming weeks before starting to build again in the fourth quarter as refineries slow throughput and higher oil prices drive some OPEC+ members to exceed their production quota to maximise revenue. ""We're bullish right now. This is the first time we've been bullish for a long, long time. Over about 18 months we've been bearish,"" he said."," Oil inventories are beginning to fall in some regions as demand outpaces supply constrained by deep production cuts from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, providing support for prices which are expected to rise in coming months.

Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) expect oil demand to outpace supply this year, leading to overall inventory draws to the tune of 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), mostly accounted for by the second half of the year.

Refineries running harder to meet rising summer demand as people drive and fly more partly explains the fall in inventories, along with a drop in Russian oil exports this month.

The bank expects benchmark Brent prices , which traded around a three-month high of $84 a barrel this week, to rise to $86 a barrel by the end of the third quarter, before easing in the fourth quarter as inventories start to build again.","[Oil, Inventory, Demand, Supply, Price]"

The Bank of Japan on Friday adjusted its yield curve control scheme, offering to buy 10-year Japanese government bonds beyond the previous 0.5% target rate while keeping unchanged its benchmark short-term rate at -0.1% and long-term bond yields at zero. The move brings the BOJ more into line with other major central banks, which have been aggressively hiking rates to reduce inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank had announced interest rates hikes this week, with markets expecting them to be nearing the end of a rate-raising cycle. U.S. inflation slowed considerably in the 12 months to June, with the personal consumption expenditures price index rising by 3%, the smallest annual gain since March 2021, data from the Commerce Department showed on Friday.

crude oil,Imperial Oil shares rise as company renews share buybacks,"July 29, 2023",https://reuters.com/markets/commodities/imperial-oil-quarterly-profit-plunges-72-production-prices-drop-2023-07-28/,"July 28 (Reuters) - Canada's Imperial Oil (IMO.TO) shares rose on Friday as investors focused on plans to renew share buybacks, despite quarterly earnings slumping 72% year-on-year as maintenance activity hit production amid a drop in energy prices. Imperial, majority-owned by Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), joined global peers in reporting a decline in second-quarter profits after oil prices fell in the second quarter, pressured by a banking crisis in which several large lenders failed and fears of a looming recession crimped demand. The Calgary-based company's earnings, however, met or exceeded analysts' expectations, and painted an optimistic picture for the second half of the year. ""While we still have major planned turnaround work ahead of us ... we expect to see stronger volumes in the second half, most notably in the upstream,"" CEO Brad Corson told analysts on a conference call. Imperial shares were last up 4.7% on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$71.47. The company said it will renew an annual normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase shares and planned to accelerate the program before the end of the year. ""With maintenance out of the way at several key assets, we see the company being well-positioned for H2/23 (the second half of 2023),"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Randy Ollenberger said in a research note, that adding Imperial could launch additional buybacks late this year or early next year. Imperial reported net income of C$675 million ($510.82 million), or C$1.15 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, down from C$2.4 billion or C$3.63 per share, a year earlier. Average realized prices for Western Canada Select, the benchmark Canadian crude, fell 39% to $58.49 per barrel while second-quarter upstream production declined 12% to 363,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), hurt by maintenance-related stoppages, the company said. Imperial's crude utilization stood at 90% in the reported quarter, lower than last year's 96% due to the impact of a planned turnaround at its Strathcona refinery in Alberta, which pushed quarterly total downstream throughput lower by 6% to 388,000 barrels per day (bpd). The company has completed construction work for expanding a seepage interception system at its Kearl oil sands mine in northern Alberta, intended to solve a months-long leak of toxic tailings water from the site that was first discovered in May 2022 and is the subject of a federal investigation.

Risk appetite in wider financial markets has been fueled by growing expectations that central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are nearing the end of policy tightening campaigns, boosting the outlook for global growth and energy demand. Bolstered by supply cuts from the OPEC+ alliance announced earlier this month, both oil benchmarks gained nearly 5% for the week - a fifth straight week of gains. The benchmarks are on track to gain over 13% for the month. Brent crude settled 75 cents higher to $84.99 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 49 cents to $80.58 a barrel. Both benchmarks fell by as much as $1 briefly earlier in the session, as investors took profits after WTI rose above $80 per barrel, Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn said. Bullish demand expectations were boosted on Thursday after U.S. second quarter gross domestic product grew at a forecast-beating 2.4%, supporting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's view that the economy can achieve a so-called ""soft landing."" Investors are warming up to the idea of peak rates getting ever closer, while it is looking increasingly probable that the United States will avoid recession, said PVM analyst Tamas Varga. Fresh data released on Friday showed some of the euro zone's top economies displayed unexpected resilience in the second quarter even as a raft of indicators pointed to renewed weakness ahead, as manufacturing ails and services slow. Meanwhile, policymakers in China have pledged to step up stimulus measures to invigorate the post-COVID recovery after the world's second-largest economy grew at a frail pace in the second quarter. In an interview on Friday, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) chief Darren Woods said he expected record oil demand this year and next. On the supply side, U.S. oil rigs fell by one to 529 this week, their lowest since March 2022, energy services firm Baker Hughes (BKR.O) said on Friday. The data is an indication of future supply. Evidence of tightening is mounting, given declining U.S. inventories and Saudi Arabia's voluntary cut of 1 million barrels per day, Commerzbank analysts said, highlighting this month could have seen OPEC oil production plunge to its lowest level since the autumn of 2021. Saudi Arabia is expected to extend the voluntary oil output cut for another month to include September, five analysts said, to provide additional support for the oil market.","

It made the disclosure in a filing with the local stock exchange. Chief Financial Officer Carlos Cortez told investors during an earnings call that despite ""significant"" government support, Pemex was evaluating whether it would tap bond markets this year or next. He gave no details on how those funds would be used. Pemex is also renewing revolving credit lines with banks. When asked about debt targets, Cortez said, ""We're committed to sustaining a downward trend."" Natural resources nationalist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has staked his reputation on reviving Pemex, which he inherited highly indebted. But concerns over the debt, the most of any state energy company in the world, has been increasing since he took office in late 2018. Under Lopez Obrador's presidency, Pemex bonds were stripped of a coveted investment grade rating. Two out of the three major ratings agencies rate the bonds speculative grade, or junk. Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service lowered its outlook on Pemex's credit ratings to negative from stable. The ratings agency said Pemex has been unable to increase capital investments and improve its financial and operating performance as a result of liquidity constraints. Pemex Chief Executive Octavio Romero dismissed the action on Friday, adding that the assessment did not sufficiently take the government's support into account. ""Pemex rejects the actions taken by these agencies,"" Romero said. Between 2019 and the end of the second quarter, Pemex received more than 720 billion pesos from the government, the results showed. Net profits were down almost 80% to 25.439 billion pesos in the second quarter from the year-ago period as sales fell, and revenues were down more than 40% to 414.156 billion pesos following weaker local sales and crude oil prices.

That put the oil count down for an eighth month in a row for the first time since drillers cut oil rigs for a record 12 consecutive months through November 2019. Gas rigs, meanwhile, rose by four rigs in July, their first increase in three months. U.S. oil futures were down about 1% so far this year after gaining about 7% in 2022. U.S. gas futures , meanwhile, have plunged about 42% so far this year after rising about 20% last year. Profits for the top two U.S. producers Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) have dropped by about half from a bumper 2022 due to weaker prices. But both companies, which have been favoring repaying shareholders over capital spending, have kept their cash distribution programs unaltered. Oilfield service providers on Thursday, however, signaled a recovery in rig count later this year, citing an uptick in oil and gas prices.

Profits for global oil majors have dropped by about half from a bumper 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil and gas prices soaring. Excluding last year's record second quarter, however, Exxon posted its strongest result for the April-to-June quarter in more than a decade, the largest U.S. oil company said, helped by cost cuts and the sale of less profitable assets. It plans further cost cutting after so far erasing $8.3 billion cumulatively since 2019. ""That is quite a good quarter for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells told Reuters. ""You would have to go back to the second quarter of 2011 to find the last time we produced this level of earnings in the second quarter"" excluding last year, she said. Net quarterly income was $7.88 billion, or $1.94 per share, versus a record $17.85 billion a year earlier. Wall Street was expecting $2.01 per share, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. ""Exxon results came in slightly weaker than expected across earnings and cash flow,"" RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria wrote in a note. Shares of Exxon were down about 2% in morning trade while rival Chevron (CVX.N), which also reported a plunge in profits on Sunday, fell about 1%. Both top U.S. producers, which have been favoring repaying shareholders over capital spending, kept their cash distribution programs unaltered. CEO Darren Woods said the company expects record oil demand this year and next year, and that this may help boost energy prices in the second half of the year. ""We will see some an upward pressure just given demand changes in the limited options we have to significantly increase supply,"" Woods estimated. All of the majors were expected to see reduced profits as benchmark Brent crude averaged $80 a barrel, far from the $110 level a year ago. Prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell to $11.75 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) from around $33 for the year-ago period. Lower natural gas realizations and industry refining margins hurt Exxon's earnings. ""Our refining business is much, much larger than our peers. So the impacts associated with changes have a bigger impact on us,"" Woods told analysts. Earnings in energy products were $2.3 billion, down $1.9 billion from the first quarter, but were offset by those in chemical products, which soared to $828 million from $371 million in the quarter, helped by lower feed costs, it said. Exxon's oil production stands at 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) year to date, in line with the company's annual target and flat from last year. Results were helped by better output in the U.S. Permian basin, which delivered 622,000 boepd in the quarter, and in Guyana, where Exxon plans to increase production by 5% to 400,000 boepd by year end, Mikells said. Capital and exploration spending was $12.5 billion for the first half of 2023, in line with the company's full-year guidance of $23 billion to $25 billion. Exxon earlier this month said it would buy gas pipeline company Denbury (DEN.N) for $4.9 billion to accelerate its energy transition business with carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations. The company will prioritize its cash distribution program over acquisitions, and will also dictate the pace of its $17 billion expenditure program on lower carbon projects through 2027 based on its commitments to shareholders, Woods said. It distributed about $8 billion in cash to shareholders in the second quarter, including about $3.7 billion in dividends.","

Exxon Mobil's second-quarter profit dropped 56% and fell short of Wall Street expectations, the company said on Friday. The company's earnings were hurt by the sharp decline in energy prices and lower fuel margins.

Excluding last year's record second quarter, however, Exxon posted its strongest result for the April-to-June quarter in more than a decade. The company plans further cost cutting after so far erasing $8.3 billion cumulatively since 2019.

CEO Darren Woods said the company expects record oil demand this year and next year, and that this may help boost energy prices in the second half of the year.","[Exxon Mobil, profit, second quarter, oil, gas]"
crude oil,TC Energy shares sink on plans to spin off oil pipeline business,"July 28, 2023",https://reuters.com/business/energy/tc-energy-shares-rise-spinoff-plans-2023-07-28/,"July 28 (Reuters) - Shares of TC Energy (TRP.TO) fell nearly 5% on Friday after the Keystone pipeline operator said it would spin off its liquids business to focus on transporting natural gas. The spinoff, combined with TC's announcement on Monday that it will sell a 40% stake in its Columbia Gas Transmission and Columbia Gulf Transmission pipelines, will help TC reduce its high debt levels. But TD Securities downgraded TC to ""hold"" from ""buy"", saying it was skeptical the spinoff would create value. ""We see execution risk introducing uncertainty and potentially distracting (TC) from its existing strategic priorities,"" TD analyst Linda Ezergailis said in a note. Shares in Toronto plunged 4.4% to C$45.21, touching a seven-year low. ""There's blood in the water, the stock has already been going down on the back of the Columbia transaction, so I think there's some (selling) piling on,"" said Ryan Bushell, president of Newhaven Asset Management, a TC shareholder. Bushell said TC's new focus after the spinoff on natural gas and power is attractive to him, however, given the expansion of liquefied natural gas export capacity in the United States and increasing electrification. Once the liquids business has spun off by late 2024, subject to a shareholder vote, it will raise C$8 billion in debt to repay debt at TC. TC CEO Francois Poirier said TC needed to sell another C$3 billion in assets during the next 18 months to reach its 4.75 times debt to EBITDA target. TC had 5.4 times debt to EBITDA last year and is aiming to reduce that to 5 times this year. The TC share sell-off reflects a re-rating after the company made the Columbia deal at a lower price than some expected, and now plans a spinoff carrying more debt compared to EBITDA than some U.S. peers, said Brandon Thimer, equity analyst at First Avenue Investment Counsel, a TC shareholder. Poirier said the breakup into two listed companies allows them to pursue more opportunities for growth that exceed the ability of one company to do. ""It's been a busy week but an extremely transformative one,” Poirier said. National Bank of Canada upgraded its rating of TC to ""outperform"" from ""sector perform"". TC's Keystone pipeline in December spilled more than 14,000 barrels of oil in Kansas. The liquids business spans over 3,000 miles of infrastructure, which transports Canadian crude to U.S. refineries. Morningstar analyst Stephen Ellis said that the 2021 cancellation of TC's proposed Keystone expansion, following U.S. President Joe Biden revoking a key permit, may have played a role in the company deciding to spin off its oil business.",": TC Energy, spinoff, liquids business, natural gas, debt

In June, OPEC+ agreed on a broad deal to limit oil supply into 2024 and Saudi Arabia pledged an additional voluntary cut for July. On July 3, Saudi Arabia said it would extend the cut for another month to include August, adding that it could be extended further. Oil prices have found some support from evidence of tightening supplies and economic stimulus in China. Brent crude was trading at over $84 a barrel on Friday, after hitting the highest level since April on Thursday. ""Given the tentative recovery, my guess is they continue the cut for one more month and then phase it out over three months - similar to what Saudi did in 2021,"" said Gary Ross, founder of Black Gold Investors and a veteran OPEC watcher. The Saudi Energy Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. In the latest comments from an OPEC member on the market, the energy minister for the United Arab Emirates told Reuters on July 21 that current OPEC+ actions are sufficient for now and the group is ""only a phone call away"" if any further steps are needed. OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, pumps around 40% of the world's crude. The group has been limiting supply since late 2022 to support the market. Another analyst, Giovanni Staunovo of UBS, also drew a parallel with Saudi actions to bolster the market two years ago. ""Looking at what they did in 2021, the full 1 million bpd cut was in place for three months, before scaling it down. So based on that they might extend it for another month,"" he said on July 25. ""But there are many moving parts at present, which might still impact the decision over the coming days."" The Saudi voluntary cut announcement for July came as a surprise at the June OPEC+ meeting, where Riyadh shared little or no detail on the measure with other delegations prior to the meeting, OPEC+ sources said. Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in July that OPEC+ would ""continue the effort at surprising markets"" and do ""whatever is necessary."" Three other analysts - Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM, Warren Patterson of ING and Macquarie analyst Vikas Dwivedi also said they thought the cut would probably be extended for September. ""I think that Saudi cuts will remain in place throughout September,"" Varga said. ""Keeping these cuts in place ... will I believe provide a better idea on how to manage the supply side of the oil equation in the fourth quarter of the year.""","

The deal discussions come amid a supply crunch for lithium. Sigma earlier this year started production at the Grota do Cirilo hard rock lithium project in Brazil to supply roughly a fourth of its output to LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) with the rest slated for sale on the spot market. Bank of America has been Sigma's bank on retainer for some time and has been holding meetings for at least four months with parties that approach with interest in acquiring the lithium miner, Sigma CEO Ana Cabral-Gardner said in an interview. She added that the company ""is focused on alternatives that embrace the importance of our shareholders' values of social sustainability."" Bank of America declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported in February, citing sources, that automaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) was considering a bid for Vancouver-based Sigma, which is listed on Nasdaq and has a market value of $4.2 billion. ""What I can confirm is that since the rumors started in February, the management continues to work to understand strategic alternatives to strengthen Sigma's and Brazil's unique environmentally competitive position on the midstream of the global supply chain,"" said Cabral-Gardner. She is also managing partner of A10 Investimentos, which owns 44% of Sigma's shares. Cabral-Gardner said that while Bank of America is coordinating meetings with parties that approach Sigma, Sigma has not yet picked a bank to advise on any potential transaction. ""Maybe I'm not selling. Maybe I'm partnering with someone. I don't know what I'm doing yet,"" Cabral-Gardner said in the interview. ""We need to find someone to marry, and when we find someone to marry, then we choose a priest,"" Cabral-Gardner said, making an analogy between an M&A banker and a priest. ""The priest is going to depend on who we're going to marry."" Cabral-Gardner added that Sigma does not plan to sell the Brazilian mine separately from the company itself. ""The company is the asset,"" she said. Because lithium demand is low in biofuel-focused Brazil, the country exports nearly all of it. Sigma has projected the mine will reach annual free cash flow of $455 million for its first phase of production.

biofuel,EU-backed auditors crack down on China island biofuel trade,"July 28, 2023",https://reuters.com/sustainability/eu-backed-green-auditor-cracks-down-china-island-biofuel-trade-2023-06-23/,"LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - (This June 23 story has been corrected to state that several auditing companies were involved in the certification audits, not one. It also clarifies that red flags were found in previous audits and adds the ISCC statement on policy to not give details of reasons for suspending certification.) Auditors suspended the sustainable fuel certification of three Chinese biofuel exporters after flagging potential issues with the sourcing of waste oil from Malaysia and Indonesia. Germany last month triggered a European Union investigation into a large volume of biofuels imports into Europe from China to assess whether the fuel meets EU sustainability criteria. The Germany-based International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) company, which oversees certification of fuel as sustainable, listed the three companies as having their sustainable certification suspended in its online database. The companies suspended were Hainan Hanpu Import and Export Trade, Hainan Bomi Import and Export Trading and Wuchuan Maosheng Bio-energy. The two Hainan-island based companies had their certification suspended in June and remain suspended. Wuchuan Maoshing had a one-month suspension that was lifted at the end of May, according to the database. The suspensions, which had not previously been reported, meant the companies could not export biofuel to the European Union. The ISCC declined to give more detail on the reasons for the suspensions when requested by Reuters. It said that as a policy it ""can and will not publish specific reasons for the suspension and withdrawal of a certificate."" Previous audit reports, however, cited the companies' inaccuracy of records, lack of traceability of sustainable materials and mislabeling of raw materials as potential risk factors for sustainability certification. The three Chinese companies and their ISCC-registered auditors - TÜV Nord, RINA and the China Quality Certification Centre - did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. EU incentives for biodiesel production made with waste oils and fat to increase renewable energy use have encouraged companies in Asia to mix biofuels with cheaper oils, especially palm oil and export them to Europe, according to top European industry body EWABA. The European Waste-based & Advanced Biofuels Association warned last month that a flood of potentially ""dubious or fraudulent"" biodiesel imports into Europe from China could trigger the collapse of the EU's biofuels industry. Audit documents for the three suspended firms listed their raw materials as coming in part from palm oil from Indonesia or Malaysia. Palm oil from the two countries is subject to steep European import duties because the EU does not classify palm oil as sustainable. The Yangpu-based firms are among the largest biofuel blenders on Hainan Island, while the mainland-based company trades in biofuel with those companies, two European trade sources said.","

biofuel,Robin Hood tariff could curb airline emissions,"July 24, 2023",https://reuters.com/breakingviews/robin-hood-tariff-could-curb-airline-emissions-2023-07-24/,"TINOS, GREECE, July 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Some readers, especially those in the northern hemisphere, may be feeling “flight shame” this summer. How can they justify jetting on holiday when temperatures are soaring across Europe, America and China? I am acutely aware of this, working from home in Greece where forest fires have been raging. Guilt is useful if it provokes action. In this case, the main solution is not for individuals to stop flying voluntarily. It is to transform the airline industry so that it doesn’t fry the planet. A key part would be to tax aviation fuel, with the richest countries and the most frequent flyers bearing the biggest burden. Aviation isn’t the planet’s biggest polluter. Nevertheless, aircraft are responsible for about 4% of global warming from carbon emissions and the vapour trails they leave behind in the sky. What’s more, the industry is growing fast. Without evasive action, it will contribute an even bigger portion of future increases in the global temperature. New types of planes powered by electric batteries or hydrogen would help. But they won’t be able to do much of the job until the middle of the century. A more viable short-term option is to run planes on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Even so the cheapest of these, biofuel, still costs about two to three times as much as kerosene, the traditional jet fuel. Biofuel uses things like cooking oil waste as its feedstock. But it’s not possible to scale it up to replace all jet fuel. Synthetic fuel, such as e-kerosene made from green hydrogen, doesn’t suffer from that problem. But it is even more expensive, costing seven to ten times the price of conventional jet fuel. The process of creating green hydrogen by electrolysing water with renewable energy and then combining it with carbon dioxide is also inherently complex. As fuel accounts for around 30% of airlines’ costs the industry isn’t going to use much SAF voluntarily. There are three ways to get the industry to switch. The first is to subsidise sustainable fuels, as the U.S. government is doing with its SAF Grand Challenge to support research, development and early deployment of new technologies. That could help kickstart the industry. But synthetic fuels will still probably be 1.5-2.5 times the price of traditional fuels by the middle of the century. Even rich governments won’t keep bridging the gap with subsidies for several decades. A second solution is to force airlines to use SAF. The European Union, for example, is requiring 6% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF by 2030; 1.2% of the fuel must be synthetic. But these are still small quantities. The third option is to tax either the kerosene that airlines burn or the emissions they spew out into the atmosphere. This would push up the price of conventional fuel, narrowing the gap with SAF. So far only the EU, United Kingdom and some smaller countries are doing this via emissions trading schemes (ETS). These require airlines to get permits for every tonne of carbon they emit on flights within Europe. These currently cost about 90 euros per tonne. But even the EU’s efforts are limited. Back in 2012 the bloc wanted to include flights leaving Europe in the scheme but backed down when countries including China and the United States objected. This is one reason that the EU is under-taxing the airline industry by 26 billion euros a year, according to the non-profit group Transport and Environment. The world’s governments could, in theory, impose a global tax on kerosene via the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United Nations agency that regulates the industry. They started such a process to tax shipping emissions via that industry’s equivalent UN agency earlier this month. But so far there’s little momentum to adopt a similar approach to airlines. French President Emmanuel Macron is one of the few leaders calling for a global tax. There are multiple blockages. One is that the United States hasn’t yet imposed carbon taxes on any industry. Another is that developing countries don’t see why their airlines should pay up for emissions when their populations don’t fly much and have contributed relatively little to climate damage. The ICAO has agreed a carbon offset scheme, which takes full effect in 2027. This requires airlines to compensate for the carbon they emit above recent levels by putting money into projects that cut emissions in other industries. But this is unlikely to make much difference, not least because the price of offsets is expected to be a fraction of the cost of the EU’s ETS permits. The ICAO did last year agree on an “aspirational” long-term goal of cutting the industry’s emissions to zero by 2050 on a net basis. If governments are serious, they will need a plan to hit this target. To work, the plan would need to channel Robin Hood, the legendary English outlaw who stole from the rich to give to the poor. Airlines operating in wealthy countries will either have to pay higher taxes than their rivals in less-developed parts of the world, or rich governments will need to give a big chunk of the taxes they raise to poor countries. Another possibility is for those passengers who fly the most, the bulk of whom are in rich countries, to pay a “frequent flyer levy” which rises the more often they travel by air. The International Council on Clean Transportation has proposed a plan to raise $121 billion a year with such a scheme. The levy would be set at zero for a traveller’s first flight in a year, rising to $177 for their twentieth trip. Rich countries might baulk. But they should realise that taxing kerosene would not only narrow the gap with more sustainable fuels, but would also provide revenue to fund subsidies to close it further. What’s more, it’s worth the developed world giving some of this money to poor countries as part of a global deal rather than putting its own aviation industry at a competitive disadvantage. Cracking this problem will be a long haul. Readers who feel flight shame could start by making it clear they would be happy to pay higher levies the more they fly.

Follow @Hugodixon on Twitter"," The airline industry is responsible for about 4% of global warming and is growing fast. New types of planes powered by electric batteries or hydrogen would help, but they won't be able to do much of the job until the middle of the century. A more viable short-term option is to run planes on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). However, the cheapest of these, biofuel, still costs about two to three times as much as kerosene, the traditional jet fuel. Synthetic fuel, such as e-kerosene made from green hydrogen, doesn't suffer from that problem, but it is even more expensive, costing seven to ten times the price of conventional jet fuel. The process of creating green hydrogen by electrolysing water with renewable energy and then combining it with carbon dioxide is also inherently complex. As fuel accounts for around 30% of airlines' costs, the industry isn't going to use much SAF voluntarily. There are three ways to get the industry to switch: subsidise sustainable fuels, force airlines to use SAF, or tax either the kerosene that airlines burn or the emissions they spew out into the atmosphere. The world's governments could, in theory, impose a global tax on kerosene via the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), but so far there's little momentum to adopt a similar approach to airlines.","[Aviation, Climate change, Fuel, Tax, Sustainable fuel]"

Vkusno & tochka already supplies waste cooking oil for production of biofuel used for heating of electric-powered buses in Moscow and has been recycling used cooking oil for over a decade. ""The test fuelling in St. Petersburg showed that the new green fuel, in terms of its technical characteristics, is fully consistent with traditional petroleum products, while its use significantly reduces the carbon footprint,"" said Anton Soboled, the director general of Gazprom Neft Marin Bunker. Irina Korshunova, in charge of sustainable development at Vkusno & tochka, said the company processes around 5,500 tonnes of waste cooking oil each year.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix or buy credits - known as RINs - from those that do. The EPA can, however, award exemptions to some small refiners if they prove that the obligations cause them undue harm. ""We will continue to fight for our rights that we believe Wynnewood (Oklahoma refinery) is entitled to,"" CVR Energy Chief Executive David Lamp said during the company's first quarter earnings call in May, before the EPA's decision last week. Par Pacific's gross RINs and environmental credit obligations stood at $347 million at the end of the first quarter 2023, based on market pricing then, a company filing showed. CVR Energy's outstanding liability was about $582 million at the end of the first quarter, another filing showed. As the EPA under President Joe Biden has not granted any refiner an exemption, the EPA's decision last week was not a surprise, Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co's Matthew Blair said in a note on Monday. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM)refiner trade group assailed the EPA's broad rejections.

The proposal would reduce rising compliance costs associated with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and aim to help struggling refineries stay afloat at a time of great flux in the global energy markets, lawmakers said. As part of the standard, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. Oil refiners argue the mandates are pricey, while biofuel proponents like ethanol producers and corn farmers like the obligations because it increases the market for their products. Under the proposed bill, refiners could buy credits around conventional biofuel blending, which includes corn-based ethanol blending, at the fixed price if they are not able to obtain them in the market at cost-effective levels, according to a news release. News of the bill caused prices for the credits, known as RINs, to dip. ""We can and must do more to address volatile and soaring compliance costs driven by fuel mandates that are out of step with domestic fuel demand,” said Chris Coons, who introduced the bill along with fellow Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican U.S. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick. It is unclear whether the measure, unveiled on Tuesday, will pass. Issues around the RFS typically draw strong lobbying efforts from both oil refining advocates and biofuel advocates. The bill must pass both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House of Representatives before it could reach President Joe Biden's desk, who would decide whether to sign it into law. Renewable fuel credits traded at $1.54 each on Tuesday after the bill came out, down from $1.56 prior, traders said.

According to the report Asia Biofuel Outlook, produced by research firm BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, India's pursuit of increased ethanol blending in gasoline, as a way to cut the oil products' import bill and reduce carbon emissions, will continue to support global sugar prices. BMI says that there is currently a fast development of additional capacity to produce ethanol in India, where the biofuel is made mainly from sugarcane. As more ethanol plants start production, more of the country's sugarcane crop will be used to make the fuel, limiting the amount of sugar that will be produced. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), India's ethanol blending has reached 11.5%, while the country's government target is to reach 20% by 2025. The report said that although it is ""doubtful"" that India will be able to achieve that by 2025, the program will cap exports of feedstocks used in ethanol production. BMI noted that Indonesia is also getting back to an ethanol blending program with a 5% rate initially, and a target to get to 10% by 2030. The research firm said that the country would need to sharply increase sugarcane planting to reach that target, and it would probably need to import ethanol to do it. Indonesia is not a regular exporter of sugar, so BMI says the program would not likely provide additional support to global sugar prices.","

""The assessment on the windfall tax is a matter for the finance minister, and it is also related also to the (guidelines of the) European Union,"" minister Pichetto Fratin said. ""It is clear that, with a view to achieving a normalisation, we all hope there should be no tax (on 2023 profits),"" he added, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of the Italian industrial lobby for energy. Rome expects to collect this year more than 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion) through a one-off windfall tax calculated on the part of 2022 corporate income which is at least 10% higher than the average income reported between 2018 and 2021. The scheme replaced a similar levy in force last year which has triggered criticism and refusals to pay from multiple firms. Attending the same event, Edison CEO Nicola Monti said the 2022 levy had increased the tax rate on the group to 72%, a level he labelled as unacceptable. The energy minister said that Italy had sent a list of projects to tap European Union funds under the REPowerEU scheme, adding that a decision by Brussels over which investments to fund was expected by August. The list of projects sent to the European Commission does not include an additional floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, the minister said but refrained from mentioning other proposals. A project for carbon capture and storage led by energy group Eni (ENI.MI) and gas grid group Snam (SRG.MI) has been included in the list of proposals, senior Eni executive Guido Brusco said. REPowerEU is designed to cut consumption, help diversify supply and enable the shift to cleaner energy. Brusco, who heads Eni's exploration and production (E&P)business, was appointed as chairman of the Italian industrial lobby for the energy sector on Friday, succeeding Giuseppe Ricci, Eni's chief for biofuel and sustainable mobility business.

However, selling in corn may have been revived late last week on a highly bearish U.S. supply outlook. Chicago corn, wheat, soybean and soybean meal futures began rallying sharply in mid-June as expanding U.S. drought and disappointing rain events hammered crop conditions. Corn, soybeans and meal topped on June 21 but eased significantly in the following sessions on improved weather forecasts. In the week ended June 27, money managers cut their net long in CBOT corn futures and options to 52,845 contracts from 58,299 a week earlier, which included reductions in both long and shorts. Trade sources had pegged the week’s net corn selling to be about four times heavier. December corn futures fell 6.1% in the week ended June 27 but had been up as much as 5.4% on June 21. The contract fell almost 12% between Wednesday and Friday, settling at $4.94-3/4 per bushel, the lowest since October 2021 and off 21% from the June 21 peak. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday revealed U.S. farmers had planted far more corn acres than analysts expected, amplifying the corn sell-off that has been mostly weather-driven. Soybean acres came in far below expectations, causing November beans to jump 6% on Friday. Soybean futures shed 3.6% in the week ended June 27 after max gains of 2.6% on June 21, though money managers increased their net long to 99,480 futures and options contracts from 76,950 a week earlier, mostly on new longs but including some short covering. Modest selling had been expected. December soymeal fell 4.3% through June 27 after max gains of 7.5% on June 21, which curbed the week’s selling. Money managers reduced their meal net long to 58,980 futures and options contracts from 63,924 in the prior week, in line with expectations. CBOT wheat futures rose 0.5% in the week ended June 27, though the contract had surged as much as 10.7% by June 26. Money managers executed a second consecutive week of heavy short covering in wheat, slashing their net short to 52,168 futures and options contracts from 84,134. That marked funds’ least bearish CBOT wheat view since November, and the two weeks ended June 27 featured speculators’ heaviest spree of short covering in six years. Gross longs were slightly reduced in both weeks. Price action in CBOT soybean oil was opposite from the others, as futures eased nearly 1% in the week ended June 27 but had been down as much as 11% with traders interpreting U.S. biofuel blending mandates negatively. Money managers covered bean oil shorts and added new longs through June 27, increasing their net long to 38,751 futures and options contracts, their most bullish view since January and up from 29,817 in the prior week. CBOT November soybeans rose nearly 4% in the last three sessions and the soy products both added more than 3%, including a limit-up move for soybean oil on Friday. December soyoil’s Friday close of 58.97 cents per pound was the highest since early March. CBOT wheat fell almost 7% between Wednesday and Friday, weighed down by corn’s 12% losses. Wheat took a back seat to corn and soybeans Friday, though USDA's estimate of June 1 U.S. wheat stocks and 2023 wheat plantings came in below analyst predictions. Trade sources peg funds’ net selling in CBOT corn futures at 55,500 contracts over the last three sessions, and CBOT wheat selling is seen at 20,500 futures contracts. Funds were seen as net buyers of 8,000 soybean futures, 9,500 soyoil futures and 3,500 soymeal futures between Wednesday and Friday. Money managers’ weekly net selling in CBOT corn futures and options has twice exceeded 100,000 contracts this calendar year. Their biggest net buying week in soybeans so far is 46,442 futures and options contracts in early April, though net buying in the latest four weeks is near 100,000 contracts.

Speculators continued covering short positions in U.S. grains and oilseeds through June 27 despite a sizable tumble in futures from the week’s highs. However, selling in corn may have been revived late last week on a highly bearish U.S. supply outlook.

Chicago corn, wheat, soybean and soybean meal futures began rallying sharply in mid-June as expanding U.S. drought and disappointing rain events hammered crop conditions. Corn, soybeans and meal topped on June 21 but eased significantly in the following sessions on improved weather forecasts.","[Corn, CBOT, soybean, soybean meal, wheat]"
biofuel,"Fashion industry driving demand for green shipping, Maersk says","June 30, 2023",https://reuters.com/sustainability/fashion-industry-driving-demand-green-shipping-maersk-says-2023-06-30/,"COPENHAGEN, June 30 (Reuters) - Fashion brands are a key driver of demand for green shipping fuels, according to shipping group Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), as the sector faces pressure from consumers and regulators to reduce their climate footprint. Retailers ship huge volumes of clothes from production centres in countries such as China, Vietnam and Bangladesh to consumers around the world, causing carbon dioxide emissions. Overall, the textile industry is estimated to be responsible for between 2% and 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a United Nations Environment Programme report published last month. The shipping industry, which itself aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, has begun offering low-emission fuels such as biofuels made from cooking oil and food waste or methanol produced from renewable energy as an alternative to fuel oil. The fashion industry accounted for 26% of the more than 240,000 containers that Maersk shipped last year using biofuels under its ECO Delivery contracts, making it the biggest sector using the low-emission fuel service, the company said. ""Many of the fashion brands have actually been the ones going for this,"" Josue Alzamora, global head of lifestyle vertical at Maersk, told Reuters at this week's Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen. ""Of course, fashion companies also feel the pressure from consumers,"" Alzamora said. Nearly one out of 10 containers Maersk, the number two global ocean container shipping firm, handled for owners of fashion brands last year was shipped using biofuels, he said. The ECO Delivery contracts are sold at a premium to regular shipping. Many fashion brands and other retailers are looking at how they can respond to environmental issues raised by their often young and relatively affluent client bases, with companies pledging to cut emissions and reduce climate impact. H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said in 2022 that over the past two years it had purchased eco fuel for a ""significant share"" of its ocean transports. It has stated its ambition to become ""climate positive"" by 2040. ""H&M was one of the first companies to join the journey with us for biofuel,"" Alzamora said. Retail giants including Amazon (AMZN.O) and IKEA have committed to switching fully to zero-carbon fuel shipping by 2040. Biofuels can reduce emissions in container shipping by more than 80% compared to standard fuel oil. Still, vessels running on biofuels only accounted for around 2% of Maersk's total seaborne volumes last year. Interest is also now also growing in methanol as an alternative fuel. Maersk has ordered 25 such vessels with the first delivery in September. In total, shipping companies have ordered more than 100 vessels that can operate on both fuel oil and methanol, according to Maersk. However, sourcing greener fuels such as methanol remains a challenge as the industry is still in its infancy. ""The fashion industry helps us to move the needle when it comes to getting more methanol produced,"" Alzamora said, pointing to the demand from the industry for alternatives given it is one of the biggest sectors for container shipping.","

biofuel,"Saudi Aramco sees 'sound' oil outlook for second half on China, India demand","June 27, 2023",https://reuters.com/business/energy/global-oil-market-fundamentals-sound-rest-2023-aramco-ceo-2023-06-26/,"KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) believes market fundamentals remain ""sound"" for the second half as demand from emerging markets led by China and India will offset recession risk in developed markets, CEO Amin Nasser told an industry gathering on Monday. But other executives at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur were divided, with Malaysia state oil firm Petronas reporting a slowdown in demand for petroleum and petrochemicals in the second quarter and growing refinery capacity putting pressure on the market. ""Overall, we believe that oil market fundamentals remain generally sound for the rest of the year,"" said Nasser, who heads the world's largest oil company. ""Despite the recession risks in several OECD countries, the economies of developing countries – especially China and India – are driving healthy oil demand growth of more than 2 million barrels per day this year,"" he told the conference. Although China faces economic headwinds, the transport and petrochemical sectors are still showing signs of demand growth, he added. Brent crude futures are down about 14% since the start of the year as rising interest rates hit investor appetite, while China's promising economic recovery has faltered after several months of softer-than-expected consumption, production and property market data. Crude oil supplies from Russia and Iran have also held up despite Western sanctions, offsetting production cuts by Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). While a failed mutiny by mercenaries in Russia over the weekend has raised concerns about political instability and pushed up oil prices, none of the industry executives and officials speaking on the first day of the conference mentioned it during their onstage remarks. ""There's not much geopolitical impact on the market now. It is dominated by economics, not geopolitics,"" Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global, said on the sidelines of the event. Russell Hardy, CEO of Vitol, the largest independent oil trader, said the industry probably faces a period of reasonably strong fundamentals in the next three or four months, but uncertainty with Russian supply and Chinese demand make it more difficult to forecast market balances and where prices are going. ""What has happened so far this year is the supply side has slightly overperformed, particularly Russia, where there were expectations of production loss as a result of the difficulty getting oil to market because of the sanctions,"" he said. Sazali Hamzah, Petronas' executive vice president and CEO of downstream, was less optimistic, saying that demand for petroleum and petrochemicals started slowing in the second quarter despite a recovery in jet fuel consumption. He expects new refining capacity coming online this year to put ""a lot of pressure on the market"". ""We believe in second-half of this year we will still see weak demand, and that will be extended to part of next year,"" he added. Looking ahead, Vitol and Petronas executives said oil demand could peak around 2030. ""We got it peaking in about 2030 and a gradual decline out to 2040 … And then (it's a) rapid decline thereafter as the EV fleet and energy transition takes over,"" Hardy said. As part of its transition, Petronas will focus on improving natural gas efficiency and find solutions for carbon abatement while exploring other renewable energy such as biofuel in the mid-term and hydrogen in the long run, Hamzah said. The company is working on a pilot plant and engineering design as it plans to start its first biorefinery in 2026. ""If the trend continues to grow, we are ready to convert the Kerteh refinery into biofuel in the future,"" Hamzah said.","

biofuel,Biden administration to spend $450 million on higher-blend biofuels,"June 27, 2023",https://reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/biden-administration-spend-450-million-higher-blend-biofuels-2023-06-26/,"WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture will spend $450 million to expand the production and availability of transportation fuels that are blended with higher volumes of biofuels, the agency said on Monday. The Biden administration sees the expanded use of lower-emission biofuels as critical to decarbonizing the transportation sector. The Environmental Protection Agency last week announced the highest-ever targets for a federal program that requires oil refiners to blend biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, though the targets were lower than the ethanol industry had expected. ""No administration has been more supportive of the biofuel industry than the Biden-Harris administration,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters on a conference call. The money, which comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, will go to the USDA's Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP), a cost-share program for fuel facilities to build and retrofit infrastructure that supports biofuel blending and distribution. The agency also announced the recipients of $25 million in grants from a previous HBIIP funding round. Senators Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a key biofuel state, joined Vilsack on the call and said the investment will create new jobs and increase national security. ""We don’t want to be dependent on other countries when it comes to energy,"" Klobuchar said. Corn-derived ethanol, the most commonly used biofuel, can cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52% over gasoline, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group. Some academics and environmental groups have challenged that figure, arguing that biofuel use actually increases emissions due to the carbon released when farmers till land for crops.","
