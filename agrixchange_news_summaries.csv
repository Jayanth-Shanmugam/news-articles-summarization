He said that Anubhav Mandapam represented the tradition of debate and expression. He reminded that India is acknowledged as the mother of democracy.  He cited many historical and archaeological instances in this regard.

He emphasized the need to carry on creating infrastructure despite opposition from vested interests. He stressed that no society can progress by working in a fragmented manner. He said that Bharat Mandapam is an example of the far-sighted holistic working style. He explained this by informing about the steps like e-conference visa facility for more than 160 countries. The capacity of Delhi Airport has gone up to 7.5 crore yearly today from 5 crore in 2014. This will be further strengthened once Jewar Airport is operational. The Hospitality Industry in Delhi NCR also expanded considerably. This indicated a planned approach of creating an entire ecosystem for conference tourism, he said.

	'The entire nation is witness to the pillars of development of the present government’s this term and the previous term', the Prime Minister remarked as he affirmed that the development journey of India is now unstoppable. Shri Modi underlined that India was the 10th largest economy in the world when the present government came to power in 2014, but as of today, India is the 5th largest economy in the world. As per track record, the Prime Minister assured that India’s name will be among the top 3 economies of the world in the third term. 'This is Modi’s guarantee', he asserted. The Prime Minister also assured the citizens that in the third term, the pace of the development journey of India will increase manifold and the citizens would see their dreams come true. 
	 
	The Prime Minister said that today India is witnessing a revolution of rebuilding as in the last 9 years, 34 lakh crore rupees were spent on the creation of infrastructure. This year too, capital expenditure is kept at 10 lakh crore, he informed. India is working at an unprecedented speed and scale. He said that in the last 9 years, electrification of 40 thousand km of railway lines took place as compared to just 20 thousand in the seven decades before that.

The number of airports increased from about 70 to about 150. City Gas distribution too reached 600 cities compared to just 60 in 2014.

Giving the example of PM Gatishakti Masterplan which is becoming a game-changer for social infrastructure, the Prime Minister said that it comprises more than 1600 layers of data and aims to save the country’s time and money. 
	 
	The Prime Minister drew attention to the era of the 1930s and said that the third decade of the last century has been critical to India’s freedom struggle where the goal was Swaraj. Similarly, the Prime Minister said, the third decade of this century is extremely crucial for India as our goal is a prosperous India, a ‘Viksit Bharat’. The Prime Minister reiterated that it was the result of the Swaraj movement that India gained independence. 'Now in this third decade, we have a target of ‘Viksit Bharat’ for the next 25 years', the Prime Minister said as he invigorated the citizens to realise the dreams of every freedom fighter. Speaking by experience, the Prime Minister said that he has witnessed many achievements unfolding before him and is aware of the nation’s strengths. 'India can become a developed country! India can eliminate poverty', the Prime Minister said. Citing a report by Niti Aayog, the Prime Minister informed that 13.5 crore people have come out of poverty in India in just 5 years. He also reiterated that extreme poverty is going away in India as mentioned by international agencies and credited the policies made and the decisions taken by the government in the last 9 years.
	 
	Emphasizing the need for clean intentions and correct policies the Prime Minister cited G-20 as an example. He said, 'We did not confine G-20 to just one city or one place. We took the G-20 meetings to more than 50 cities in the country. We showcased India's diversity through this. We showed the world what is India's cultural power, what is India's heritage.' Further elaborating on the manner of the G20 Presidency, the Prime Minister concluded, 'New facilities were built in many cities for G-20 meetings and old facilities were modernised. This benefited the country and the people of the country. This is good governance. We are going to make India developed by following the spirit of Nation First, Citizen First.'
	 
	Union Minister for Trade and Commerce, Shri Piyush Goyal, numerous other Union Ministers and Ministers from the government and leading industry experts were present on the occasion.
	 
	Background
	 
	The Prime Minister’s vision of having a world-class infrastructure for hosting meetings, conferences and exhibitions in the country has led to the conceptualization of the International Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC) at Pragati Maidan. The project revamps the old and outdated facilities at Pragati Maidan and developed as a National project at a cost of about Rs 2700 crores. With a campus area of approximately 123 acres, the IECC complex has been developed as India’s largest MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) destination. In terms of the covered space available for events, the IECC Complex finds its place among the top exhibition and convention complexes in the world. The newly developed IECC complex at Pragati Maidan comprises multiple state-of-the-art facilities including Convention Centre, Exhibition halls and amphitheatre etc.
	 
	The Convention Centre is developed as the centrepiece of the Pragati Maidan complex. It is a grand architectural marvel, designed to host large-scale international exhibitions, trade fairs, conventions, conferences, and other prestigious events. It is equipped with multiple meeting rooms, lounges, auditoriums, an amphitheatre and a business centre making it capable of hosting a wide range of events.  Its majestic multi-purpose hall and plenary hall have a combined capacity of seven thousand people, which is larger than the seating capacity of the famous Sydney Opera House in Australia. Its magnificent Amphitheater is equipped with a seating capacity of 3,000 individuals.
	 
	The architectural design of the Convention Centre building is inspired by Indian traditions and showcases India’s confidence and conviction in its past while also embracing modern facilities and way of life. The shape of the building is derived from the Shankha (conch shell), and different walls and facades of the Convention Centre depict several elements of India's traditional art and culture including ‘Surya Shakti’ highlighting India’s efforts in harnessing solar energy,  ‘Zero to ISRO’, celebrating our achievements in space,  Pancha Mahabhuta signifying the building blocks of universal foundation - Aakash (Sky), Vayu (Air), Agni (Fire), Jal (Water), Prithvi (Earth), among others. Also, various paintings and Tribal art forms from different regions of the country adorn the Convention Centre.
	 
	Other facilities available in the Convention Centre include 5G-enabled fully Wi-Fi-covered campus, 10G Intranet connectivity, interpreter room equipped with cutting-edge technology to support 16 different languages, advanced AV systems with huge-sized video walls, building management system ensuring optimal functionality and energy efficiency, light management system with dimming and occupancy sensors, state-of-the-art DCN (Data Communication Network) system, integrated surveillance system and energy-efficient centralized air conditioning system.
	 
	Further, the IECC complex features seven exhibition halls and each one serves as a versatile space for hosting exhibitions, trade fairs, and business events. The exhibition halls are designed to accommodate a diverse range of industries and showcase products and services from around the world. These state-of-the-art structures are a testament to modern engineering and architectural prowess.
	 
	The development of the area outside the IECC is also thoughtfully designed that complements the beauty of the main complex and is a testimony of the careful planning and development that has gone into this project. The sculptures, installations, and murals showcase the rich cultural heritage of India; Musical Fountains add an element of enchantment and spectacle; Water Bodies such as ponds, lakes, and artificial streams, enhance the tranquillity and aesthetics of the area.
	 
	The convenience of visitors is a priority at the IECC, reflected in the provision of over 5,500 vehicle parking spaces. The ease of access through signal-free roads ensures visitors can reach the venue without any hassle. Also, the overall design prioritizes the comfort and convenience of attendees, facilitating seamless movement within the IECC complex.
	 
	The development of the new IECC complex at Pragati Maidan will help in the promotion of India as a global business destination. It will also play a vital role in boosting trade and commerce, leading to economic growth and job creation. It will support the growth of small and medium enterprises by providing them with a platform to showcase their products and services on a national and international stage.

	Riding on the massive demand from global markets, chilli exports from India crossed 10,000-crore mark during 2022-23. With AP being the leading producer, about 50 per cent of the stock was exported from the state. The total exports from India were just around 6,500 crore in 2019-20.
	 
	The continuous export orders helped farmers make huge returns during the just concluded sale season. The crop in the Indian market usually enters around the middle of December while the markets start flooding with the stocks by middle of January.
	The unexpected rains and floods during last November-December damaged chilli crop in many districts of the state. The crop output was reduced by at least 30-40 per cent leaving farmers worried over facing huge losses. Luckily, a booming export market brought cheers to the faces of farmers.
	 
	The prices in retail market have continuously hovered around 20,000 per quintal, which is an all-time high in recent history. The average price farmers fetched last year was around 10,000-12,000 per quintal. In fact, a price not less than 8,000 per quintal is said to be remunerative to recover the costs.
	However, the overall cost went up due to the damage of over 30-40 per cent crop.
	Interestingly, prices, which would normally go up after the farmers selling their stocks, remained high right from the beginning of the season and stable throughout till the completion of sales. This helped farmers make a killing during the last season. The sale value jumped by almost 25 per cent despite a dip in the volume of total exports during the 2022-23.
	 
	High prices in the export market helped the traders as well as the farmers. The total volume of exports witnessed a fall of nearly 40,000 tonnes when compared to last year’s exports. The chilli exports were steadily going up from India due to the demand from European countries, China, Sri Lanka and the USA.
	India exported nearly 6.46 lakh tonnes making 9,241 crore during 2020-21 when the entire world was stalled following the outbreak of Covid-19. Trade analysts say that the demand for chilli will continue to go up in the coming season too based on positive inputs from global exporters.","

India's chilli exports crossed 10,000 crore mark during 2022-23, up from 6,500 crore in 2019-20. The bumper exports were driven by high demand from global markets, especially European countries, China, Sri Lanka and the USA.

ICAR Sees Normal Paddy Sowing This Season.,"July 27, 2023",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/icar-sees-normal-paddy-sowing-this-season/articleshow/102115651.cms,"
	The country will see 'normal sowing' of paddy this kharif season, the National Rice Research Institute at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) said, allaying fears of any further increase in the food grain's prices that had peaked on account of sluggish sowing and higher exports.
	 
	There is no cause of worry for the paddy crop either in rainfall-deficient states or even in those states witnessing excessive rainfall and flooding, said AK Nayak, director at the apex rice research institute in the country.
	 
	Retail prices of non-basmati rice had increased 3% in the past one month and 11.5% in one year, despite the imposition of a 20% export duty in September 2022. This prompted the government to impose a ban on the export of non-basmati white rice.
	 
	In the eastern parts of the country, rainfall activity has picked up, boosting sowing, said Nayak, adding that the sowing window in these areas is open till August. 'This will make up for any lack in the beginning of the season,' he said.
	 
	Talking about northern states such as Punjab and Haryana which have been impacted by excessive rains and flooding, he said the paddy crop has a high tolerance for standing water and any damage is caused only if there is water above the canopy for 6-7 days or if there is submergence.
	 
	'No extensive submergence has been reported yet which will cause a significant decline in output,' Nayak said. The institute is satisfied with the way sowing of paddy has panned out in southern states during this kharif season, he said.
	 
	Despite India seeing a rainfall activity of 5% more than normal, a large part of the country is deficient in rainfall.
	 
	Most paddy-growing states such Kerala, West Bengal (Gangetic), Bihar, Jharkhand, UP (East) and Telangana have seen deficient rains. Punjab and Haryana - major rice producers in the North - have received excessive rain, causing concerns about the standing crop.","

	The FSSAI has decided to extend the date of enforcement of FSS (Advertising and Claims) Second Regulations, 2022, for six months from June 13 so that food businesses could exhaust their existing food packaging materials.

	'After due consideration of the representation received from industry and also to ensure sustainable practices for food business operations, it has been decided to extend the date of enforcement of Sub-Regulation 7 of Regulation 4 of FSS (Advertising and Claims) Second Regulations, 2022, by a further period of six months from 13th June 2023,' reads the order.
