U.S. EPA denies nearly all biofuel blending exemption petitions,3:13 AM GMT+5:30,https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/biden-administration-issue-decision-small-refinery-exemptions-friday-2023-07-14/,"NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration on Friday denied almost all outstanding petitions from oil refiners asking to be exempted from mandates that require them to mix biofuels into their fuel. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has the authority to issue the exemptions, denied 26 petitions from 15 small refineries who applied for waivers for the 2016-2018 and 2021-2023 compliance years, the agency said on Friday. There are still two pending petitions. The agency also disclosed which oil refiners submitted petitions in July 2022 or later, as well as which oil refiners are participating in an alternative compliance schedule that allows them flexibility in complying with biofuel blending laws. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. The EPA can, however, award exemptions to some small refiners if they prove that the obligations cause them undue harm. Biden has been trying to set the United States on track to reduce carbon emissions in the fight against climate change, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The administration has not yet extended a waiver to any refinery, reversing the policy of former President Donald Trump, whose administration granted 34 exemptions to oil refiners for the 2017 compliance year alone. The EPA consulted with the Department of Energy on Friday's waiver decisions and found that none of the petitioning small refineries demonstrated they face disproportionate economic hardship caused by their RFS compliance, the agency said. The EPA publicized on Friday the names of refiners that submitted small-refinery exemption petitions from July 2022 or later. The agency added this information to its website to reflect its commitment to transparency around RFS decisions, it said. Refiners that submitted petitions included Calumet Montana Refining and Ergon Refining. Their petitions were denied. The agency also publicized the names of refiners that are using an alternative schedule to prove RFS compliance. Among those listed were Sinclair Wyoming Refining Company and Kern Oil and Refining Company. Data from the EPA showed 17 small refineries have opted into the alternative compliance schedule for the 2020 compliance year, the only compliance year shown in the data. The group had retired 360 million credits to show compliance, and had 510 million credits outstanding, EPA's website showed.","

US lawmakers seek to lower biofuel blending compliance costs,"July 13, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-lawmakers-seek-lower-biofuel-blending-compliance-costs-2023-07-12/,"NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation this week directing the Biden administration to allow oil refiners to purchase compliance credits for U.S. biofuel blending laws at a lower, fixed cost compared to the open market. The proposal would reduce rising compliance costs associated with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and aim to help struggling refineries stay afloat at a time of great flux in the global energy markets, lawmakers said. As part of the standard, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. Oil refiners argue the mandates are pricey, while biofuel proponents like ethanol producers and corn farmers like the obligations because it increases the market for their products. Under the proposed bill, refiners could buy credits around conventional biofuel blending, which includes corn-based ethanol blending, at the fixed price if they are not able to obtain them in the market at cost-effective levels, according to a news release. News of the bill caused prices for the credits, known as RINs, to dip. ""We can and must do more to address volatile and soaring compliance costs driven by fuel mandates that are out of step with domestic fuel demand,” said Chris Coons, who introduced the bill along with fellow Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican U.S. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick. It is unclear whether the measure, unveiled on Tuesday, will pass. Issues around the RFS typically draw strong lobbying efforts from both oil refining advocates and biofuel advocates. The bill must pass both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House of Representatives before it could reach President Joe Biden's desk, who would decide whether to sign it into law. Renewable fuel credits traded at $1.54 each on Tuesday after the bill came out, down from $1.56 prior, traders said. Credits traded on Wednesday between $1.55 and $1.56 each amid U.S. government data release.","

Italy hopes it can avoid repeat of energy windfall taxes,"July 10, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/italy-hopes-it-can-avoid-repeat-energy-windfall-taxes-2023-07-07/,"ROME, July 7 (Reuters) - Italy hopes it can avoid a repeat of windfall levies that energy groups had to pay on their 2021 and 2022 profits to fund measures aimed at shielding customers from costly electricity and gas bills, the energy minister said on Friday. ""The assessment on the windfall tax is a matter for the finance minister, and it is also related also to the (guidelines of the) European Union,"" minister Pichetto Fratin said. ""It is clear that, with a view to achieving a normalisation, we all hope there should be no tax (on 2023 profits),"" he added, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of the Italian industrial lobby for energy. Rome expects to collect this year more than 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion) through a one-off windfall tax calculated on the part of 2022 corporate income which is at least 10% higher than the average income reported between 2018 and 2021. The scheme replaced a similar levy in force last year which has triggered criticism and refusals to pay from multiple firms. Attending the same event, Edison CEO Nicola Monti said the 2022 levy had increased the tax rate on the group to 72%, a level he labelled as unacceptable. The energy minister said that Italy had sent a list of projects to tap European Union funds under the REPowerEU scheme, adding that a decision by Brussels over which investments to fund was expected by August. The list of projects sent to the European Commission does not include an additional floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, the minister said but refrained from mentioning other proposals. A project for carbon capture and storage led by energy group Eni (ENI.MI) and gas grid group Snam (SRG.MI) has been included in the list of proposals, senior Eni executive Guido Brusco said. REPowerEU is designed to cut consumption, help diversify supply and enable the shift to cleaner energy. Brusco, who heads Eni's exploration and production (E&P)business, was appointed as chairman of the Italian industrial lobby for the energy sector on Friday, succeeding Giuseppe Ricci, Eni's chief for biofuel and sustainable mobility business.

"Bunge, Chevron acquire Argentina's Chacraservicios to meet renewable diesel demand","July 7, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bunge-chevron-acquire-argentinas-chacraservicios-meet-renewable-diesel-demand-2023-07-05/,"July 5 (Reuters) - Grains merchant Bunge (BG.N) and oil major Chevron (CVX.N) said on Wednesday they have acquired Argentina-based agricultural product company Chacraservicios, as the companies look to expand their renewable energy footprint. Chacraservicios, which is focused on the cultivation of Camelina sativa, a crop with high oil content, will contribute to Bunge and Chevron's global supply chains by adding a new oil source to meet the growing demand for lower carbon renewable feedstocks, the companies said. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Renewable diesel emits lesser emissions by roughly 4.2% for carbon dioxide from the same volume of regular diesel, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, when compared with both biodiesel and regular diesel. That makes it attractive to logistics firms and other companies seeking to lower their supply chain pollution levels. Expanding production of renewable diesel depends on increasing the supply of oils made from crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday cut its estimate of how many acres of soybeans, a key source of vegetable oil, had been planted. Bunge has in the past two years entered partnerships with Chevron to crush oilseeds for renewable diesel, and with seedmaker Corteva (CTVA.N) to tailor crops for biofuel feedstocks. Bunge, the world's biggest oilseed crusher, last month agreed to acquire Viterra in a deal that would help it secure a larger role in the expanding renewable diesel industry.","

Italy's Eni wants to reduce oil exposure with asset sales,"July 5, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/italys-eni-wants-reduce-oil-exposure-with-asset-sales-2023-07-04/,"ROME, July 4 (Reuters) - Italy's Eni (ENI.MI) aims to reduce its exposure to oil in favour of natural gas and non-fossil fuels in part through asset sales, the energy group's CEO Claudio Descalzi said on Tuesday. Speaking at the Rome presentation of a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Descalzi added he could not comment on potential oil asset sales in the near term. Eni plans to generate 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of net proceeds from the balance between asset sales and acquisitions between 2023 and 2026, the company said in its business plan. Last month, Eni announced the sale of some of its oil assets in Congo, just a few days after saying it had agreed to buy Neptune Energy. Descalzi said the acquisition would reduce Eni's average carbon intensity, since Neptune is focused on natural gas. The deal also provides an opportunity to expand the carbon capture and storage business of Eni's Vaar business in northern Europe. ""This is why the acquisition of Neptune is not in contrast with the energy transition path,"" Descalzi said. Eni will attend the COP28 climate summit later this year in Dubai, participating directly in the event for the first time, the CEO said. The group will present its investment projects in Africa, including the development of renewable energy and the creation of agri-hubs to produce feedstock for its biofuel business, he said. In a recent assessment of efforts to meet the key Paris accord target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, IRENA said the energy transition was currently ""off-track"".

"Column: Funds avoid heavy selling in CBOT grains, oilseeds despite price skid","July 5, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/funds-avoid-heavy-selling-cbot-grains-oilseeds-despite-price-skid-2023-07-03/,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois, July 2 (Reuters) - Speculators continued covering short positions in U.S. grains and oilseeds through June 27 despite a sizable tumble in futures from the week’s highs. However, selling in corn may have been revived late last week on a highly bearish U.S. supply outlook. Chicago corn, wheat, soybean and soybean meal futures began rallying sharply in mid-June as expanding U.S. drought and disappointing rain events hammered crop conditions. Corn, soybeans and meal topped on June 21 but eased significantly in the following sessions on improved weather forecasts. In the week ended June 27, money managers cut their net long in CBOT corn futures and options to 52,845 contracts from 58,299 a week earlier, which included reductions in both long and shorts. Trade sources had pegged the week’s net corn selling to be about four times heavier. December corn futures fell 6.1% in the week ended June 27 but had been up as much as 5.4% on June 21. The contract fell almost 12% between Wednesday and Friday, settling at $4.94-3/4 per bushel, the lowest since October 2021 and off 21% from the June 21 peak. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday revealed U.S. farmers had planted far more corn acres than analysts expected, amplifying the corn sell-off that has been mostly weather-driven. Soybean acres came in far below expectations, causing November beans to jump 6% on Friday. Soybean futures shed 3.6% in the week ended June 27 after max gains of 2.6% on June 21, though money managers increased their net long to 99,480 futures and options contracts from 76,950 a week earlier, mostly on new longs but including some short covering. Modest selling had been expected. December soymeal fell 4.3% through June 27 after max gains of 7.5% on June 21, which curbed the week’s selling. Money managers reduced their meal net long to 58,980 futures and options contracts from 63,924 in the prior week, in line with expectations. CBOT wheat futures rose 0.5% in the week ended June 27, though the contract had surged as much as 10.7% by June 26. Money managers executed a second consecutive week of heavy short covering in wheat, slashing their net short to 52,168 futures and options contracts from 84,134. That marked funds’ least bearish CBOT wheat view since November, and the two weeks ended June 27 featured speculators’ heaviest spree of short covering in six years. Gross longs were slightly reduced in both weeks. Price action in CBOT soybean oil was opposite from the others, as futures eased nearly 1% in the week ended June 27 but had been down as much as 11% with traders interpreting U.S. biofuel blending mandates negatively. Money managers covered bean oil shorts and added new longs through June 27, increasing their net long to 38,751 futures and options contracts, their most bullish view since January and up from 29,817 in the prior week. CBOT November soybeans rose nearly 4% in the last three sessions and the soy products both added more than 3%, including a limit-up move for soybean oil on Friday. December soyoil’s Friday close of 58.97 cents per pound was the highest since early March. CBOT wheat fell almost 7% between Wednesday and Friday, weighed down by corn’s 12% losses. Wheat took a back seat to corn and soybeans Friday, though USDA's estimate of June 1 U.S. wheat stocks and 2023 wheat plantings came in below analyst predictions. Trade sources peg funds’ net selling in CBOT corn futures at 55,500 contracts over the last three sessions, and CBOT wheat selling is seen at 20,500 futures contracts. Funds were seen as net buyers of 8,000 soybean futures, 9,500 soyoil futures and 3,500 soymeal futures between Wednesday and Friday. Money managers’ weekly net selling in CBOT corn futures and options has twice exceeded 100,000 contracts this calendar year. Their biggest net buying week in soybeans so far is 46,442 futures and options contracts in early April, though net buying in the latest four weeks is near 100,000 contracts.

"Fashion industry driving demand for green shipping, Maersk says","July 4, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/fashion-industry-driving-demand-green-shipping-maersk-says-2023-06-30/,"COPENHAGEN, June 30 (Reuters) - Fashion brands are a key driver of demand for green shipping fuels, according to shipping group Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), as the sector faces pressure from consumers and regulators to reduce their climate footprint. Retailers ship huge volumes of clothes from production centres in countries such as China, Vietnam and Bangladesh to consumers around the world, causing carbon dioxide emissions. Overall, the textile industry is estimated to be responsible for between 2% and 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a United Nations Environment Programme report published last month. The shipping industry, which itself aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, has begun offering low-emission fuels such as biofuels made from cooking oil and food waste or methanol produced from renewable energy as an alternative to fuel oil. The fashion industry accounted for 26% of the more than 240,000 containers that Maersk shipped last year using biofuels under its ECO Delivery contracts, making it the biggest sector using the low-emission fuel service, the company said. ""Many of the fashion brands have actually been the ones going for this,"" Josue Alzamora, global head of lifestyle vertical at Maersk, told Reuters at this week's Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen. ""Of course, fashion companies also feel the pressure from consumers,"" Alzamora said. Nearly one out of 10 containers Maersk, the number two global ocean container shipping firm, handled for owners of fashion brands last year was shipped using biofuels, he said. The ECO Delivery contracts are sold at a premium to regular shipping. Many fashion brands and other retailers are looking at how they can respond to environmental issues raised by their often young and relatively affluent client bases, with companies pledging to cut emissions and reduce climate impact. H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said in 2022 that over the past two years it had purchased eco fuel for a ""significant share"" of its ocean transports. It has stated its ambition to become ""climate positive"" by 2040. ""H&M was one of the first companies to join the journey with us for biofuel,"" Alzamora said. Retail giants including Amazon (AMZN.O) and IKEA have committed to switching fully to zero-carbon fuel shipping by 2040. Biofuels can reduce emissions in container shipping by more than 80% compared to standard fuel oil. Still, vessels running on biofuels only accounted for around 2% of Maersk's total seaborne volumes last year. Interest is also now also growing in methanol as an alternative fuel. Maersk has ordered 25 such vessels with the first delivery in September. In total, shipping companies have ordered more than 100 vessels that can operate on both fuel oil and methanol, according to Maersk. However, sourcing greener fuels such as methanol remains a challenge as the industry is still in its infancy. ""The fashion industry helps us to move the needle when it comes to getting more methanol produced,"" Alzamora said, pointing to the demand from the industry for alternatives given it is one of the biggest sectors for container shipping.","

But other executives at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur were divided, with Malaysia state oil firm Petronas reporting a slowdown in demand for petroleum and petrochemicals in the second quarter and growing refinery capacity putting pressure on the market. ""Overall, we believe that oil market fundamentals remain generally sound for the rest of the year,"" said Nasser, who heads the world's largest oil company. ""Despite the recession risks in several OECD countries, the economies of developing countries – especially China and India – are driving healthy oil demand growth of more than 2 million barrels per day this year,"" he told the conference. Although China faces economic headwinds, the transport and petrochemical sectors are still showing signs of demand growth, he added. Brent crude futures are down about 14% since the start of the year as rising interest rates hit investor appetite, while China's promising economic recovery has faltered after several months of softer-than-expected consumption, production and property market data. Crude oil supplies from Russia and Iran have also held up despite Western sanctions, offsetting production cuts by Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). While a failed mutiny by mercenaries in Russia over the weekend has raised concerns about political instability and pushed up oil prices, none of the industry executives and officials speaking on the first day of the conference mentioned it during their onstage remarks. ""There's not much geopolitical impact on the market now. It is dominated by economics, not geopolitics,"" Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global, said on the sidelines of the event. Russell Hardy, CEO of Vitol, the largest independent oil trader, said the industry probably faces a period of reasonably strong fundamentals in the next three or four months, but uncertainty with Russian supply and Chinese demand make it more difficult to forecast market balances and where prices are going. ""What has happened so far this year is the supply side has slightly overperformed, particularly Russia, where there were expectations of production loss as a result of the difficulty getting oil to market because of the sanctions,"" he said. Sazali Hamzah, Petronas' executive vice president and CEO of downstream, was less optimistic, saying that demand for petroleum and petrochemicals started slowing in the second quarter despite a recovery in jet fuel consumption. He expects new refining capacity coming online this year to put ""a lot of pressure on the market"". ""We believe in second-half of this year we will still see weak demand, and that will be extended to part of next year,"" he added. Looking ahead, Vitol and Petronas executives said oil demand could peak around 2030. ""We got it peaking in about 2030 and a gradual decline out to 2040 … And then (it's a) rapid decline thereafter as the EV fleet and energy transition takes over,"" Hardy said. As part of its transition, Petronas will focus on improving natural gas efficiency and find solutions for carbon abatement while exploring other renewable energy such as biofuel in the mid-term and hydrogen in the long run, Hamzah said. The company is working on a pilot plant and engineering design as it plans to start its first biorefinery in 2026. ""If the trend continues to grow, we are ready to convert the Kerteh refinery into biofuel in the future,"" Hamzah said.","

Biden administration to spend $450 million on higher-blend biofuels,"June 30, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/biden-administration-spend-450-million-higher-blend-biofuels-2023-06-26/,"WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture will spend $450 million to expand the production and availability of transportation fuels that are blended with higher volumes of biofuels, the agency said on Monday. The Biden administration sees the expanded use of lower-emission biofuels as critical to decarbonizing the transportation sector. The Environmental Protection Agency last week announced the highest-ever targets for a federal program that requires oil refiners to blend biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, though the targets were lower than the ethanol industry had expected. ""No administration has been more supportive of the biofuel industry than the Biden-Harris administration,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters on a conference call. The money, which comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, will go to the USDA's Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP), a cost-share program for fuel facilities to build and retrofit infrastructure that supports biofuel blending and distribution. The agency also announced the recipients of $25 million in grants from a previous HBIIP funding round. Senators Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a key biofuel state, joined Vilsack on the call and said the investment will create new jobs and increase national security. ""We don’t want to be dependent on other countries when it comes to energy,"" Klobuchar said. Corn-derived ethanol, the most commonly used biofuel, can cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52% over gasoline, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group. Some academics and environmental groups have challenged that figure, arguing that biofuel use actually increases emissions due to the carbon released when farmers till land for crops.","

From indoor farming to alternative proteins: the entrepreneurs looking to feed the world,"June 27, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/indoor-farming-alternative-proteins-entrepreneurs-looking-feed-world-2023-06-26/,"June 20 - Plant-based foods, vertical farming, active packaging, robotics in agriculture, even remote farm control systems using satellites: the list of technologies that promise to feed the world as well as mitigate climate change is ever-growing. Technological innovations are being developed along multiple levels of the food system, from farm level to the supply chain, including retail, transport, consumption, waste management and packaging. The problems they attempt to solve are numerous and complex, but they are a vital part of the picture in mitigating and adapting to climate change. A 2021 study published in the journal Nature cited food systems as the cause of one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, the global population is forecast to grow from seven billion in 2010 to 9.8 billion in 2050, while incomes grow across the developing world, leading to an overall rise in food demand of more than 50%, according to the World Resources Institute. Demand for more resource-intensive foods such as meat and dairy products is projected to rise even faster, by nearly 70%, it says. Added to which, hunger and malnourishment are still rife, affecting more than 800 million people today. The global food network must simultaneously produce more food, using less land, energy and water, and distribute it to more people, while producing less waste. It is no small ask. Consultants at Morgan Stanley recently ranked 10 key agriculture tech sectors. Most promising were alternative proteins, seeds that can reduce crop loss and optimise the use of resources such as nitrogen, land and water, and precision agriculture. These sectors provide high growth, compelling risk-reward, significant customer benefits, and are supported by favourable policy initiatives, the consultancy said. Agri-food testing, animal health and organic and naturally healthy food came next on its list, judged to be low-risk, with reasonable growth opportunities. It was less convinced by innovations in crop protection and fertilisers, due to concerns over sustainability and government policy, while it flagged vertical farming and aquaculture to be potential areas to watch. For Stuart Thomson, senior manager of food and agriculture at PwC, the most promising technologies fall into two areas. First: the collection, analysis and use of data that can monitor farm performance, and its impact on climate change, soil quality or water use, and second: engineering solutions that allow farmers to use precision farming techniques such as spraying individual pests, or controlled environment farming in greenhouses using renewable energy. The latter is seeing a boom in the U.S., according to Travis Parman, chief communications officer at startup AppHarvest. “There is a lot of opportunity with controlled-environment agriculture, because the U.S. is so under-built,” he says. “It is a way to really de-risk our fresh fruit and vegetable production.” The company grows tomatoes, salads, strawberries and cucumbers in Appalachia using high-tech indoor farms with robotics and artificial intelligence. It claims its farms are producing yields up to 30 times that of traditional agriculture, using up to 90% less water than if the crops were grown on fields. The company, which launched in 2017, built its first greenhouse by 2019, and harvested its first crop in 2021. It now has four farms consisting of some 67 hectares under glass, and believes there are only two companies in the U.S. with greater capacity. Like all startups, it has had to overcome multiple hurdles. Construction of the farms was capital- intensive. The company obtained venture capital, and also decided early on to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange, says Parman. Bids for funding were aided by the fact that a combination of climate change impacts, such as a mega-drought in the south-west of the U.S. and COVID-19, had exposed weaknesses in the food system to public scrutiny. “The headline issues helped people recognise that we really do have a domestic food security issue, and we do need a more climate-resilient solution for this,” he says. Awareness of the need to decarbonise the global agri-food system has motivated support from investors for food product innovator Terviva, according to Marc Diaz, the company’s chief commercial officer. Over the past 13 years, Terviva has developed products from the pongamia tree, a tree traditionally used in Asia in medicine, and for lamp oil and fertiliser. The tree is both low-input and high-yielding, with an ability to grow on degraded land, and absorbs both carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere. The company developed technology to remove the bitter taste of the seeds, which had previously prevented it from being used as food. The tree’s seeds contain high levels of protein and oil, which can be used for cooking, or as an ingredient in foods such as vegan mayonnaise, cakes and biscuits, or meat and dairy alternatives. It has recently launched an energy bar with Hawaiian protein company Aloha made with the oil. Terviva is also planning to supply crude oil from the tree as biofuel feedstock. Ashley Kleckner, the company’s senior vice president of sales and marketing, acknowledges that this is a “faster to market path” while it builds up the food side of the business. The company’s ability to support decarbonisation in the industrial and transport sectors, as well as reduce Scope 3 emissions from global food producers had provided “incredible tailwinds” for investment, raising the company over $100 million in 13 years, according to Diaz. Terviva is now growing pongamia trees with farmers in Australia and Hawaii, and is paying people in India to harvest beans from the trees growing wild there. However, the company has worked to attract a certain type of investor, since the trees do not bear harvest for four years. Over the past five to seven years, its investors have mostly been those who are climate-focused, and understand that the company’s business model is long-term, and its products are not “Zeitgeisty” or being launched with a “sustainability halo”, says Kleckner. “What we’re solving is specific supply-chain challenges and risk mitigation,” she says. Locating operations in different geographies and combining wild harvest as well as agroforestry models is an important part of the company’s business model, she adds. “Fundraising is never easy, so it would be ridiculous for us to claim that people are lining up outside the door, but we've actually had fairly good luck and we have really amazing investors because of the way our business is structured,” she says. Much of the media coverage of climate-friendly innovations in food have centred around alternative proteins. These have seen huge growth in the past couple of years, according to Alison Rabschnuk, director of business development for plant protein at Kerry Group. Kerry Group has been involved with the development of plant-based foods for several decades, working as an effective innovation arm for other companies by using technologies to help them develop plant-based foods, she explains. “The number of launches went through the roof, not only in retail, but also in food service, and all of a sudden plant-based products were everywhere. A lot of retailers had to scramble to actually find the shelf space from which to merchandise these products,” Rabschnuk says. Parman also flags issues around finding distribution and buyers for the end product as a challenge for many startups in the sector, particularly smaller players. “Fortunately, we have a distributor that is well networked throughout the U.S. and through our contract with them they take our product to the top restaurants and grocery stores,” he says. Despite current challenges, commentators are positive about the future of innovation in food. Diaz believes that startups will be key to helping large global businesses tackle their Scope 3 emissions. “This is one of the big trends that I think startups ought to take real heed of. If you’re a large food company, 95% of your supply chain emissions are in farms and the gathering of commodity crops like palm, coffee and cocoa, and they increasingly need different ways of being produced, or substitutes. There is going to be a really promising pathway for startups that can make a durable change in strategic supply chains.” Rabschnuk sees a role for continued innovation in food, which could drive mass adoption of more sustainable foods by making them cheaper, more tasty and more convenient. She gives the example of precision fermentation, a refined form of brewing, under which microbes are multiplied to create animal proteins or specific enzymes. “There are absolutely technologies that aren't available today, that will be in five or 10 years,” she says. “It's just a matter of getting the scale and the regulatory approval to move forward.” Thomson sees a future shift in data provision, so that consumers will have much more insight of the origins of the food and can choose accordingly. At the moment, the number of people wanting to know more about the origins of their food is quite small, but that reflects the challenge of accessing data, he says. “The days of putting a picture of a farmer on a packet of carrots to communicate a brand working with farmers will be gone. There will be genuine technology, such as QR codes to enable the consumer to track and trace their products back to specific farms.” “I think we'll see some big changes in the next in the next five years, both in terms of how supply chains function, but also in terms of what's happening on the ground in farms,” he says. “It’s really exciting.”","

"Column: Funds spooked out of CBOT shorts by parched US corn, soy crops","June 27, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/funds-spooked-out-cbot-shorts-by-parched-us-corn-soy-crops-2023-06-26/,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois, June 25 (Reuters) - Speculators were forced to abandon more short positions in Chicago grains and oilseeds last week as U.S. crop health further deteriorated under an exceptional dry spell. In the four-day week ended June 20, money managers erased a combined 100,000 gross short positions across CBOT corn, wheat, soybeans, soy products, Kansas City and Minneapolis wheat, the most for any week since August 2020. Money managers also added 45,000 gross longs last week, the most in four months and driven primarily by corn, where new longs outnumbered short covering. Net buying in soybeans last week was split between new longs and short covering, though funds’ latest moves in CBOT wheat and soybean oil were exclusively the result of short covering. In the week ended June 20, money managers extended their net long in CBOT corn futures and options to 58,299 contracts from 2,145 in the prior week, establishing their most bullish view since Feb. 28. They also increased their net long in CBOT soybeans to a two-month high of 76,950 futures and options contracts versus 47,882 a week earlier. Both new-crop corn and soybean futures rose more than 8% in the week ended June 20 amid near-record dryness in top-producing U.S. states. Money managers increased their net long in CBOT soybean oil futures and options to 29,817 contracts through June 20 from 8,748 in the prior week on near 8% gains in December soyoil futures . Funds’ net soyoil buying in the latest two weeks was the strongest for any two-week period since February 2019. July and December CBOT wheat futures both rose more than 9% through June 20, and money managers cut their net short position to a 17-week low of 84,134 futures and options contracts from 113,430 a week earlier. Short covering for the week was the strongest since May 2019. December soybean meal climbed almost 7% in the week ended June 20, but funds’ net reaction was relatively muted as their net long increased by about 3,300 to 63,924 futures and options contracts. After the market closed on June 20, both U.S. corn and soybean conditions fell below the range of analyst guesses for the week. At the same time, U.S. biofuel blending volumes mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency were immediately seen as disappointing, weighing on the soy complex. U.S. corn was only 55% good or excellent as of June 18, the week’s worst since 1992 and the lowest for any June or July week since 2012. December corn made a new yearly high of $6.29-3/4 per bushel Wednesday, taking out the prior high of $6.11 set Jan. 3. November soybeans topped out Wednesday at $13.78 per bushel, their highest since March 8, but below the Jan. 3 high of $14.15-3/4. Weather forecasts late last week increased rain hopes for parched U.S. crops, easing futures. December corn and November soybeans fell 1.6% and 2.4%, respectively, over the last three sessions. December soybean oil shed 4.7% between Wednesday and Friday and December meal lost 1.1%, but nearby and deferred CBOT wheat futures added 5% on global supply concerns, especially in the United States and the Black Sea.

US lawmaker to re-introduce bipartisan bill to get EV industry into biofuel program,"June 26, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-lawmaker-re-introduce-bipartisan-bill-get-ev-industry-into-biofuel-program-2023-06-23/,"NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. Democratic lawmaker plans to reintroduce a bipartisan bill next month that would allow electricity generated from renewable biomass to qualify for credits under the nation's biofuel blending program. The Biden administration abandoned a similar scheme over concerns that it could trigger lawsuits. read more . Under the bill's plan, producers of power generated from renewable gas and then used for charging electric vehicles (EVs) would be eligible to generate lucrative credits under the U.S. Renewable Fuels Standard. That differs slightly from the now-discarded approach that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had unveiled in December, which allowed EV manufacturers like Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) to generate the credits. ""The manufacturers do not produce the electricity. It is the biomass/biogas industry that does,"" Representative John Garamendi from California, the sponsor of the bill, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. ""We know that the biomass/biogas industry can produce electricity in a way that is beneficial to the overall economy and ecology of the nation and the world,"" he added. The bill directs the EPA, which administers the RFS, to implement the plan. Under the RFS, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. The new EV pathway would be a major overhaul of that program by expanding it to include stakeholders in the electric vehicle industry. Garamendi originally introduced the bill in 2021, with bipartisan cosponsors including Representative Jack Bergman, a Republican from Michigan, and Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican from Iowa. It did not receive a hearing when last introduced. Garamendi expects similar support for the bill this time around, he said, adding that the bill is already receiving more support from industries including the timber industry, a potential source of the biomass. Groups including the Renewable Fuel Standard Power Coalition, the Biomass Power Association and the American Loggers Council have endorsed the impending bill. The bill would also make biomass removed from federal forestlands eligible under the RFS as renewable biomass. Current law only allows for biomass collected from non-federal lands.","

EU-backed green auditor cracks down on China island biofuel trade,"June 26, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/eu-backed-green-auditor-cracks-down-china-island-biofuel-trade-2023-06-23/,"LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - An auditing company empowered by the European Union to verify sustainable fuel has suspended the certification of three Chinese biofuel exporters after an audit found the precise source of their waste products from Malaysia and Indonesia could not be verified. Germany this month triggered a European Union investigation into a large volume of biofuels imports into Europe from China to assess whether the fuel meets EU sustainability criteria. The Germany-based International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a company that verifies the sustainability of fuel, suspended the certification of two companies headquartered in the port of Yangpu on China's Hainan Island and another at Zhanjiang nearby on the mainland. The month-long suspensions mean the companies cannot export to the EU and were detailed in audit reports posted to the ISCC's online database of tens of thousands of biofuel producers and traders worldwide. The suspensions have not previously been reported. The companies the ISCC suspended were Hainan Hanpu Import and Export Trade, Hainan Bomi Import and Export Trading and Wuchuan Maosheng Bio-energy. The suspensions took effect in early May and June and last for a month. Wuchuan Maosheng Bio-energy's suspension finished at the end of May. The ISCC said in audit reports that the inaccuracy of records, lack of traceability of sustainable materials and mislabeling of raw materials were the reasons for suspending the companies. The three companies and the ISCC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. EU incentives for biodiesel production made with waste oils and fat to increase renewable energy use have encouraged companies in Asia to mix biofuels with cheaper oils, especially palm oil and export them to Europe, according to top European industry body EWABA. The European Waste-based & Advanced Biofuels Association warned this month that a flood of potentially ""dubious or fraudulent"" biodiesel imports into Europe from China could trigger the collapse of the EU's biofuels industry. The ISCC audit documents for the three suspended firms list their raw materials as coming in part from palm oil from Indonesia or Malaysia. Palm oil from the two countries is subject to steep European import duties because the EU does not classify palm oil as sustainable. The Yangpu-based firms are among the largest biofuel blenders on Hainan Island, while the mainland-based company trades in biofuel with those companies, two European trade sources said.","

"US boosts biofuel mandates over next 3 years, but biofuel groups feel shortchanged","June 24, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-boosts-biofuel-mandates-over-next-3-years-biofuel-groups-feel-shortchanged-2023-06-21/,"June 21 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday increased the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next three years, but the plan has angered the biofuel industry, which says mandates for corn-based ethanol and biodiesel are not high enough. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finalized biofuel blending volumes at 20.94 billion gallons in 2023, 21.54 billion gallons in 2024 and 22.33 billion gallons in 2025. That compares with the initial proposal announced in December of 20.82 billion in 2023, 21.87 billion in 2024, and 22.68 billion in 2025. But the finalized volumes include just 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels like corn-based ethanol in all three years, plus a 250 million-gallon supplemental amount for 2023. That represents a decline from the initial proposal, which included 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels in 2023 and 15.25 billion gallons in both 2024 and 2025. The plan also has modest increases to biomass-based diesel volumes compared with the proposal, despite a major lobbying push from groups that produce biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel to boost volumes higher. The announcement drew strong rebukes from ethanol and biodiesel advocates. ""The industry responded to signals from the Biden administration and Congress aiming to rapidly decarbonize U.S. fuel markets, particularly aviation, marine, and heavy-duty transport, and make clean fuels available to more consumers,"" said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs with Clean Fuels, a biodiesel group. ""The volumes EPA finalized today are not high enough to support those goals."" Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the finalized mandates fail to fully support benefits that biofuels can provide to farmers and consumers. The Renewable Fuels Association called the reductions in ethanol mandates ""inexplicable"" and ""unwarranted."" The final rule marks a new phase in the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, which is more than a decade old and frequently pits the powerful oil and biofuel industries against each other. Under the RFS, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix, or buy tradable credits from those that do. Ethanol producers and corn farmers like the mandates because they provide a market for their products, while the oil industry finds the requirements too pricey. While Congress set out specific goals for the program through 2022, the law expands the EPA's authority for 2023 and beyond to change the way the RFS is administered. The EPA said the finalized rule would reduce reliance on foreign sources of oil by between 130,000 to 140,000 barrels per day over 2023-2025. U.S. renewable fuel credit prices dropped 8% following the news, trading at $1.34 each from as much as $1.46 each the day prior, traders said. Biomass-based credits dropped to $1.38 each from $1.48 each the previous day. The futures market fell sharply in reaction to the lower-than-expected biofuel mandates, with most Chicago Board of Trade soyoil contracts locked down their daily 4 cent-per-lb trading limit. The soyoil market had rallied to its highest in nearly 3-1/2 months last week. The EPA also set out a series of regulatory changes in the final rule, in an effort to strengthen the agency's implementation of the RFS program. The agency will modify provisions for biogas-derived renewable fuels to ensure that biogas is produced from renewable biomass and used as a transportation fuel, as well as to allow for the use of biogas as a biointermediate. Absent from the rule, however, was a much-anticipated pathway for electric vehicle manufacturers to generate lucrative credits under the RFS, though it was included in the original proposal in December. Reuters previously reported that the administration was planning to abandon the scheme over worries about lawsuits. The plan would have given EV automakers, such as Tesla (TSLA.O), credits for charging vehicles using power generated from renewable natural gas, or methane collected from sources such as cattle or land fills. The EPA said on Wednesday it will continue to assess stakeholder comments it received on the EV scheme, and it will work on potential paths forward for it. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers said it was pleased to see the EPA abandon the EV program, saying the RFS is a liquid fuels program that should not include electric vehicles."," The Biden administration on Wednesday increased the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next three years, but the plan has angered the biofuel industry, which says mandates for corn-based ethanol and biodiesel are not high enough.

Under the deal to create an agricultural giant worth about $34 billion including debt, Bunge's crushing capacity will increase by nearly one-third, to 75 million metric tons annually, adding plants in Europe, Canada and Argentina. The deal would make the combined company better able to capitalize on an anticipated surge in demand for soybean and canola oil to produce biofuels in coming years than its rivals, but more consolidation in the industry leaves farmers with fewer buyers for their crops. Though its grain trading business is smaller than rivals Cargill and ADM, U.S.-based Bunge (BG.N) is already the world's largest oilseed processor and producer of vegetable oil. Oils produced primarily from soy and canola are seeing increasing demand from refiners for low-carbon renewable diesel. ""This really accelerates the strategic growth platform that we've laid out,"" Bunge CEO Greg Heckman said in an interview on Tuesday. Bunge has in the past two years entered partnerships with oil major Chevron (CVX.N) to crush oilseeds for renewable diesel and seedmaker Corteva to tailor crops for biofuel feedstocks. Its investment in startup Covercress gives Bunge access to future supplies of a new low-carbon-intensity oilseed for crushing. ""(Buying Viterra) allows us to fill in some of the areas where we needed additional origination, where we needed to be closer to the farmer to drive regenerative ag and sustainable practices,"" Heckman said. Viterra's large network of grain shipping terminals and country elevators, particularly in oilseed production regions of North America, Argentina and Europe, would complement Bunge's existing oilseed processing business, analysts said. In the United States, the deal marks a reversal after Bunge sold 35 grain elevators in 2021, citing poor profits. Viterra's elevators have better locations across Bunge's network, Heckman said. The Viterra network would aid Bunge's processing plants by both purchasing oilseeds from farmers and shipping products like livestock meal, analysts said. ""Scale is key in this business and the more points along the value chain you possess, the more opportunity you have,"" said Ben Bienvenu, equity research analyst at Stephens. ""Bunge (stock) was a way to express a bullish view on the renewable diesel buildout via equity prior to this deal. And it's only more so post this deal,"" he said. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in February that annual U.S. renewable diesel production could more than double by 2025, driven in part by tax credits for renewable fuels under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. While some developers have cancelLed or delayed renewable diesel projects due to rising costs, long-term demand for cleaner-burning fuel remains attractive, a factor that likely convinced Bunge to bolster its crushing operations, said Tore Alden, senior agriculture analyst at Fastmarkets, a price reporting agency. ""I think it's prescient,"" he said. ""(Bunge) is taking the long-term view that renewable diesel can continue to grow beyond the initial, fervored capacity build-out."" Soybean oil accounts for 28% of feedstock used to make renewable diesel, and 60% of the feedstock for biodiesel, a biofuel that blends with petroleum diesel, said Matthew Blair, an analyst at TPH&Co. Viterra's crushing businesses could face regulatory scrutiny in Canada and Argentina, and elsewhere, analysts said. Both have canola-crushing plants in Eastern and Western Canada, including facilities in southern Manitoba. Canada's antitrust regulator will review the planned merger, a spokesperson said. Argentina's competition bureau has not yet received formal notification of the merger, a government source said. An EU Commission spokesperson also said the transaction had not been formally notified to the Commission. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it was aware of the plan to merge and is monitoring developments."," Bunge's planned acquisition of Viterra would make the world's biggest oilseed crusher even more dominant and secure a larger role in the expanding renewable diesel industry.

"Bunge, Viterra will merge to form $34 billion agri-trading powerhouse","June 15, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bunge-merge-with-viterra-form-18-billion-agriculture-trader-2023-06-13/,"CHICAGO, June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. grains merchant Bunge (BG.N) and Glencore-backed (GLEN.L) Viterra are merging to create an agricultural trading giant worth about $34 billion including debt, the companies said on Tuesday, in a deal that will likely draw close regulatory scrutiny. The deal brings the combined company closer in global scale to leading rivals Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM.N) and Cargill (CARG.UL), valuing Bunge and Viterra at about $17 billion each. Bunge shareholders, however, will own about 70% of the company, because Bunge will pay for a significant chunk of the deal with cash. The deal is unprecedented in size in the global agriculture sector. It comes after Bunge posted record adjusted profits in 2022, benefiting from tight global grain supplies due to the war with Ukraine. Bunge shares rose more than 2%. Under the deal, Viterra shareholders will get about 65.6 million shares of Bunge stock, carrying a value of about $6.2 billion, and about $2 billion in cash. Bunge will also assume $9.8 billion of Viterra's debt, according to a joint statement. Viterra shareholders will own 30% of the combined company following the deal's expected close in mid-2024. ""The companies are highly complementary,"" Chief Executive Greg Heckman said in an interview. ""The way the assets and teams fit together, the strategic merit is one that we've looked at for years ... Things just finally aligned."" Reuters first reported the terms of the deal on June 8. Bunge is already the world's largest oilseed processor and analysts said it and Viterra's crushing businesses could face regulatory scrutiny in Canada, Argentina and elsewhere. Canada's antitrust regulator will review the planned merger, a spokesperson for the regulator said in a statement. Argentina's competition bureau has not yet received formal notification of the merger, a government source said. The U.S. Department of Justice and antitrust regulators in the European Union did not respond to requests for comment. Last year, Bunge was the largest corn and soybean exporter from Brazil, the world's top source of the staple crops for making animal feed and biofuels, according to data from shipping agent Cargonave. Viterra was the third-largest corn exporter and No. 7 soybean shipper. In the United States, Viterra's business of buying and selling grain expanded via its purchase of Gavilon last year. The merger would enhance Bunge's grain exporting and oilseed processing businesses in the world's No. 2 corn and soy exporter, where it has a smaller presence than ADM and Cargill. The deal also expands Bunge's physical grain storage and handling capacity in major wheat exporter Australia, where the company currently operates just two grain elevators and a port terminal in the western part of the country. Viterra has 55 storage sites in South Australia and western Victoria and six bulk grain export terminals. Fitch Ratings said its BBB rating for Bunge could be raised to BBB+ if the deal closes as anticipated. Sustained annual earnings of $4 billion are ""a very reasonable target"" for the company after the merger, John Neppl, Bunge's chief financial officer, said in an interview. Bunge's management team, led by CEO Greg Heckman who took over the top role in 2019 when the company itself was a takeover target, will oversee the combined entity. Heckman oversaw a portfolio review that led Bunge to scale back or sell underperforming operations such as South American sugar and Mexican wheat milling and invest in its core edible oils business. The company reported record earnings last year after a string of quarterly losses in 2018. Heckman previously led Gavilon from 2008 to 2015. The Consumer Federation of America said the deal would reduce competition for farmers' crops and consolidate processing of oilseeds used to make plant-based foods as well as biofuel at a time the Biden administration is broadly trying to promote competition in the economy. ""Further concentration seems likely to harm consumers and the businesses, like plant-based food manufacturers, that rely on these commodities,"" said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy for the Federation. Bunge said it plans to repurchase $2 billion of its stock to enhance accretion from the deal to adjusted profit. The deal is being backed by a financing commitment of $7 billion from Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and British Columbia Investment Management Corp said they have agreed to support the deal, indicating that all Viterra shareholders are on board. CPPIB said it would own 12% of the combined company. In Ukraine, the world's top sunflower producer and largest supplier of sunflower oil, a combined Bunge-Viterra would have three oilseed processing plants across the country's south and east - in Kharkiv, Dnipro and Mykolaiv. Acquiring Viterra would bring Bunge's revenue, which was $67.2 billion in 2022, more in line with that of ADM, which registered sales of nearly $102 billion last year. The merger is expected to generate about $250 million of annual gross pre-tax operational synergies within three years.","
