"Wall St holds gains after cooler inflation, mixed earnings",2:18 AM GMT+5:30,https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2023-07-14/,"July 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks mostly held on to their previous gains on Friday, while the dollar stayed near 15-month lows, after U.S. inflation data this week unleashed a wave of investor optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve was nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle. Data showed on Wednesday U.S. consumer prices growing at their slowest pace in more than two years, and on Thursday the smallest increase in U.S. producer inflation in nearly three years. On Friday, the government reported that U.S. import prices dropped 0.2% last month, and U.S. consumer sentiment jumped to the highest level in nearly two years. The MSCI World Equity index (.MIWD00000PUS) was little changed on Friday, staying at its peak for the year and its highest level since early 2022. Wall Street stocks were muted following steady gains earlier in the week, after mixed quarterly reports from bank and other financial firms, offsetting gains in UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) and other health insurer stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.33%, to 34,509, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.10%, to 4,505 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 0.18%, to 14,113. European stock indexes were little changed, with the STOXX (.STOXX) down 0.11% and London's FTSE 100 down 0.08% (.FTSE). Germany's DAX was down 0.2%, pulling back on recent gains (.GDAXI). Michele Morganti, senior equity strategist at Generali Investments in Rome, urged caution. He said price-to-earnings ratios were ""exuberant"" versus real rates and economic growth, especially in the U.S. ""We are still cautious on equities short term due to sticky core inflation, tightening credit conditions and macro indicators pointing south,"" Morganti said in an email. U.S. government bond yields bounced back slightly on Friday after sharp declines earlier in the week. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 6.3 basis points at 3.822%. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 15 basis points (bps) at 4.761%. Euro zone government bond yields were little changed on Friday, with bonds holding on to their gains after a powerful two-day rally triggered by soft U.S. inflation numbers. Money market traders still expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 bps on July 26, but they have reduced the chances of another one after that this year . Norman Villamin, chief group strategist at UBP, said he expected another Fed rate hike in July, but that the September meeting was more uncertain. ""We're probably closer to the end of the cycle,"" he said, although he added that above-target inflation was still expected to persist in the longer term. ""Getting the 3% (inflation reading) is one thing, getting back to 2% is going to be a much harder task,"" Villamin said. ""That puts a floor on how low bond yields can go again."" The dollar hovered near a 15-month low on Friday, its biggest weekly decline since November after softening U.S. inflation data. The euro was steady at $1.1223, having earlier touched its highest in more than 16 months . Oil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday as the dollar strengthened and oil traders booked profits from a strong rally, with crude benchmarks recording their third-straight weekly gain. U.S. crude fell 2% to $75.33 per barrel and Brent was at $79.75, also down about 2% on the day. Gold prices eased, down about 0.3% on Friday, but were on track for their biggest weekly gain since April, after signs of slowing U.S. inflation.","

Iraq-Iran gas-for-oil barter would likely violate US sanctions,1:43 AM GMT+5:30,https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/iraq-iran-gas-for-oil-barter-would-likely-violate-us-sanctions-2023-07-14/,"WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - A barter of Iranian natural gas for Iraqi oil as described by the Iraqi prime minister this week would likely violate U.S. sanctions on Tehran unless the U.S. issued a waiver permitting it, three former U.S. officials said on Thursday. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani on Tuesday said Iraq would begin trading crude oil for Iranian gas to end recurring payment delays to Tehran due to required U.S. approval for such transactions. Sudani said Iran had cut gas exports to Iraq by more than half as of July 1 after Baghdad failed to secure U.S. approval to disburse owed funds, but Tehran had now agreed to resume gas exports in exchange for crude oil. There are few details available about the potential barter, which could help defuse a political problem for Sudani since power cuts are unpopular during the sweltering Iraqi summer when temperatures can top 50 Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). However, three former U.S. officials said a barter would likely run afoul of U.S. sanctions. ""It would be a violation of U.S. sanctions to conduct this kind of a barter transaction with Iran absent a U.S. national security waiver being issued,"" said Richard Goldberg of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. ""This would be prohibited under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act, which prohibits any transaction related to energy with Iran,"" added Goldberg, who served on the Trump administration national security council staff. Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a 120-day waiver on March 21, a State Department official said, allowing Iraq to pay Iran only for electricity imports, not for natural gas to fuel Iraqi domestic power generation. ""The March 2023 waiver, granted by the Secretary, allows Iraq to purchase electricity from Iran. Nothing else,"" said the official on condition of anonymity. That waiver was announced by the State Department on March 31. There has been speculation the waiver might be amended to allow barter, an issue the official declined to address. ""We are not in a position to preview any future decisions related to the waiver. We have no comment at this time regarding reports of a barter arrangement between Iraq and Iran,"" the official said. The Iraqi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Former U.S. officials said the Treasury Department, which oversees most U.S. sanctions against Iran, defines the term ""transaction"" so broadly that it would cover a barter exchange. ""The test is whether it's a 'significant' transaction. The test is not whether it's denominated in one currency or another or whether ... it's a barter,"" said a former senior Treasury official on condition of anonymity. The former official said that could provide ""enough wiggle room ... for the U.S. to look the other way, but that is a political decision, that's not a legal question. ""As far as a strictly legal question, it absolutely does violate U.S. sanctions,"" he added.","

"Oil prices fall on profit-taking, still record weekly gain",12:59 AM GMT+5:30,https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-prices-up-tighter-supply-lower-us-inflation-2023-07-14/,"BENGALURU, July 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday as the dollar strengthened and oil traders booked profits from a strong rally, with crude benchmarks recording their third-straight weekly gain. Brent crude futures settled at $79.87 per barrel, down $1.49, or 1.8%, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $1.47, or 1.9%, to settle at $75.42 a barrel. ""It just appears to be some profit taking, with some demand concerns coming back to the front and center as the dollar rebounds,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. The U.S. dollar index (.DXY) edged higher after hitting a 15-month low during the session, as investors consolidated ahead of the weekend. A stronger greenback reduces oil demand, making crude more expensive for investors holding other currencies. Next week, however, the rally could resume as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions could support the market, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,"" Haworth said. Oil prices gained nearly 2% on a weekly basis, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months. Several oilfields in Libya were shut down on Thursday because of a local tribe's protest against the kidnapping of a former minister. Separately, Shell suspended loadings of Nigeria's Forcados crude oil owing to a potential leak at a terminal. The Libya disruption is halting an estimated 370,000 barrels per day (bpd) while the loss from the Nigerian outage is pegged at 225,000 bpd, said PVM analyst John Evans. Russian oil exports have also decreased significantly and, if this trend continues next week, it would probably drive prices up further since Russian oil exports are set to be reduced by 500,000 bpd in August, added Commerzbank analysts.

Factbox: Oil supply disruptions boost prices,"July 14, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-supply-disruptions-boost-prices-2023-07-14/,"LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - A series of oil supply disruptions across the globe has helped push Brent crude prices above $81 a barrel for the first time since April. Forecasters expect OPEC+ supply cuts and ramped up demand from China to tighten markets despite some macroeconomic headwinds. Below are details on recent disruptions: Shell (SHEL.L) on July 13 said it had suspended loadings of Nigeria’s Forcados crude oil due to a potential leak at the export terminal. Exports of the medium sweet grade, which was scheduled to ship 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July, were scuttled on Wednesday after workers saw fumes near the single buoy mooring that was loading oil onto a vessel, sources told Reuters. Technical problems have beset Forcados, one of the largest crude oil streams from Africa's top exporter, on and off for several months. Nigeria is expected to supply 1.23 million bpd of roughly 102.1 million bpd of projected global oil demand in 2023, according to the latest International Energy Agency (IEA) figures. Production at three Libyan oilfields ceased on July 13 in protest against the abduction of a former finance minister, a tribal leader, oil engineers and a protester told Reuters. One of the inactive fields, Sharara, is one of country's largest production areas with capacity of 300,000 bpd. It has been a frequent target of political strife. Libya is expected to supply 1.16 million bpd of projected global oil demand in 2023. Production plummeted by around a fifth in early July due to a widespread power outage in the region. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), the main export pipeline for Kazakh crude oil, stopped three pumping stations in western Kazakhstan as a result, but continued pumping oil from Tengiz, the country’s biggest field by output. Recovery from the outage is now underway, but output so far remains below June's average of 1.8 million bpd. Kazakhstan is expected to supply 1.57 million bpd of projected global oil demand in 2023. Mexico's state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is set to lose 100,000 bpd of crude output until the beginning of August after a massive fire on July 7 at an offshore platform, a top company source said. Pemex, which produces in total about 1.6 million bpd of oil, will lose at least 2 million barrels of crude through the end of July, according to Reuters estimates. Mexico is expected to supply 1.67 million bpd of projected global oil demand in 2023. Turkey halted Iraq's 450,000 bpd of exports through a crude oil pipeline from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on March 25. Turkey's decision followed an arbitration ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which ordered Turkey to pay Baghdad damages of $1.5 billion for unauthorised exports by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) between 2014 and 2018. Sources told Reuters in June that talks to discuss the halted exports had resumed. Iraq as a whole is expected to supply 4.24 million bpd of projected global oil demand in 2023.","

Oil prices have risen to $81 a barrel for the first time since April, as a series of supply disruptions across the globe tightens markets.

The disruptions include a potential leak at the Forcados export terminal in Nigeria, which could cut exports of the medium sweet grade by 220,000 barrels per day (bpd).

Production at three Libyan oilfields has also ceased in protest against the abduction of a former finance minister, while a widespread power outage in Kazakhstan has led to a drop in output.

Mexico's state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is also set to lose 100,000 bpd of crude output after a fire at an offshore platform.

Oil prices are expected to remain high, as OPEC+ supply cuts and ramped up demand from China offset some macroeconomic headwinds.","[Oil, Supply, Disruption, Brent, Crude]"

"Exclusive: Russia sets plans for oil export cuts in August, sources say","July 14, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-sets-plans-oil-export-cuts-august-sources-2023-07-14/,"MOSCOW, July 14 (Reuters) - Russian oil exports from western ports are set to fall by some 100,000-200,000 barrels per day next month from July levels, a sign Moscow is making good on its pledge for fresh supply cuts in tandem with OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, two sources said on Friday, citing export plans. OPEC and major producers including Russia, together known as OPEC+, have been cutting supply since November to support prices. Moscow this month pledged to cut exports by 500,000 bpd in August, while Saudi Arabia extended its 1 million bpd output cuts. As Russia did not reveal the baseline for its cut, analysts and traders had said it would be difficult to monitor. But according to trading sources and Refinitiv Eikon data, the August cuts will deepen export reductions between May and July that already total 500,000 barrels per day. July oil loadings from western ports, such as Primorsk and Ust-Luga in the Baltic Sea and Novorossiisk in the Black Sea, are set to fall to 1.9 million bpd this month compared to 2.3 million bpd in June and 2.4 million bpd in May. Russia exports oil and products via the Pacific and a direct pipeline to China as well as its European ports. Its export plans via eastern export routes are not yet available. Three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Russia had instructed oil companies to reduce supply plans for the next month. Its energy authorities held a meeting with the companies' top managers earlier this week, asking them to make more efforts to guarantee lower exports in August. A spokesperson for Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who is in charge of Moscow's relations with OPEC+, did not reply to requests for comment. Novak said on Thursday that Russian companies themselves would decide whether to cut oil production in August, but that Russia's task was to reduce supplies to world markets. Russia's total crude and products exports are estimated at up to 7 million bpd, but data has been secret since the country's actions in Ukraine, which Moscow calls special military operation. Prior to Russia's announcement of plans to reduce overseas supplies, OPEC+ was only managing oil production, not exports. Igor Sechin, a powerful head of Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft, first hinted at the need to reduce exports as well as output last month. Russian offline primary oil refining capacity is seen rising by 40% in August from July, making additional oil export cuts next month even tougher for many. If Russia wants to cut oil exports in August from July, companies may postpone some planned works to autumn months to increase domestic oil consumption, or cut oil production, traders said.","

Russia is set to cut oil exports by 100,000-200,000 barrels per day in August, in line with its pledge to OPEC+. The move is likely to support oil prices, which have been rising in recent months due to supply concerns. Russia's total crude and products exports are estimated at up to 7 million bpd, but data has been secret since the country's actions in Ukraine.","[Russia, oil, export, cut, OPEC]"

The official also said the Reserve Bank of India will release guidance for banks in two to three days to resolve some teething issues on the rupee trade mechanism.

Column: US exporting disinflation via dollar slide,"July 14, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/us-exporting-disinflation-via-dollar-slide-2023-07-14/,"LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - An accelerating dollar slide could be a U.S. gift to its allies by helping them catch up with its impressive disinflation. Seeing headline U.S. inflation tick below 3% for the first time in more than two years in June electrified world markets this week by encouraging a belief the Federal Reserve can finally end its 15-month credit tightening this month. Bond yields recoiled and stock markets surged to 2023 highs. But it was the dollar exchange rate that took the heat of 'peak Fed' excitement and the greenback's DXY index against the most traded currencies (.DXY) plumbed its lowest levels since April 2022 - its biggest weekly drop of the year so far. That dollar index is now down a whopping 4.5% in just six weeks, propelling the euro to its highest since March 2022, sterling to a 15-month peak and Switzerland's franc to its best level in eight years. Even the recently ailing yen jumped. While these moves are still part of an unwinding of the supercharged dollar gains of 2021 and 2022, they can still pack a punch for world economies dancing with recession. A dollar slide of this size and speed has typically elicited yelps of pain from U.S. trading partners. All things equal, it both squeezes their exports to the U.S. while sucking in cheaper U.S. imports at home. But given the dominant battle against inflation and serial 'cost of living' crises, the dollar's swoon right now may be far more welcome than usual overseas. The impressive reversal of headline U.S. inflation back close to the Fed's 2% target - from last year's bruising 40-year cresting at 9.1% - has been a major relief stateside and well ahead of schedule. The June readout is already below the International Monetary Fund's best guess for the yearend. But that sort of progress has been lacking in Europe so far. Euro zone headline inflation - which peaked about one percentage point above and three months later than the U.S. equivalent last year - was still 2.5 points above it last month. The UK picture is even worse - peaking at more than 11% last October but still almost six points above U.S. inflation in May as we await the June update from Britain next week. But a sliding dollar may aide the catch-up, even at the margin. Not only does Europe directly import cheaper U.S. goods and services as a result of a lower dollar, it cheapens the cost of dollar-denominated energy, commodity and food prices still aggravating consumer prices everywhere. And, even if less welcome, it dampens domestic demand via exporters' margin hits that can also further sap inflation. The crux of any trade-off on that score is that additional disinflation via exchange rates, even if marginal, will remove at least some pressure on the Bank of England and European Central Bank (ECB) to 'outhawk' the Fed once the latter's done. Right now, money markets assume the Bank of England will have to leapfrog an expected Fed 'terminal rate' of 5.25% to 5.50% and lift rates another 100 basis points from here to more than 6.0% over the next year. The ECB will likely stay shy of peak Fed rates, but an expected move to 4.0% policy rates by year-end will involve two quarter point hikes after the Fed has stopped. Can a sharp dollar plunge head that off if it bites deeper into stubborn inflation? Sceptics will say the complicated mechanics of exchange rate ""pass-through"" to consumer inflation means the effect will be too slight, particularly within the euro zone where the bulk of trade is between member states. They also contend that residual price stickiness is now mostly in domestic services-related inflation that's less sensitive to currency shifts. However, the dollar's role in energy and commodity pricing and more generally in international trade invoicing means the pulse can be sizeable. Underlining that point late last year, when warning of an inflation pulse from a then-rising dollar, the IMF pointed out while the U.S. share of world goods exports had declined by four percentage points to 8% since 2000, the dollar's share in world exports has held at around 40%. It also cited estimates that on average a 10% dollar move had a 1% impact on inflation over time - albeit likely skewed to emerging economies more prone to trade swings. And even if the scale of the impact on Transatlantic trade may be arguable, a steep dollar drop could help European countries offset a likely fading of the negative year-on-year base effects in crude oil prices -- base effects that have been central to the drop in headline inflation rates this year. But then, as so often, the financial market arguments become a bit circular and head spinning. In some respects, the idea reverses again the 'reverse currency wars' theme first adopted by Goldman Sachs over the past year - where it posited that an excessively strong dollar exaggerated inflation and interest rate rises outside the U.S. and potentially amplified economic downturns there. A time-limited dollar drop now may be more benign than a simple reversion to a new 'currency war'. And a steep enough fall now may just neutralise the rationale for the move in the first place - by helping rein in expectations of overseas tightening once the Fed has stopped. Self-regulating or dizzying? The gift of dollar weakness may simply be some borrowed time and relief from monetary overkill. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.","

The dollar has been declining against other major currencies in recent weeks, and this could be a boon for European countries. A weaker dollar makes U.S. goods and services cheaper for Europeans to buy, which could help to boost their economies. Additionally, a weaker dollar could help to offset the impact of rising interest rates in Europe.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to raise interest rates in July, and this could lead to a slowdown in economic growth. However, a weaker dollar could help to mitigate the impact of these higher rates.

Overall, the decline of the dollar could be a positive development for Europe. It could help to boost economic growth and offset the impact of higher interest rates.","[Dollar, Inflation, Interest rate, Trade, Europe]"
"Cooler inflation keeps stocks up, dollar and yields down","July 14, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-pix-2023-07-13/,"July 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose again and global equities hit new highs for 2023 on Thursday, while the dollar and Treasury yields continued to slide, as slowing U.S. inflation stoked bets that the Federal Reserve will pause rate hikes after this month. Wall Street's main stock indexes built on Wednesday's sharp gains after data showed that consumer prices rose modestly in June, registering the smallest annual increase in more than two years. Other data on Thursday showed that U.S. producer prices barely rose in June, U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly declined, and Chinese exports dropped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.14%, to 34,394.29, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.85%, to 4,509.96 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 1.58%, to 14,138.57. Bets that the Federal Reserve could soon end its monetary tightening campaign sent the dollar (.DXY) to its lowest level since April 2022 and pushed the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes to near a two-week low. Interest rate futures showed markets have fully priced in another rate hike from the Fed at its upcoming meeting later this month, but expectations of further increases this year have faded. The MSCI All Country stock index (.MIWD00000PUS) was up 1.2%, hitting a new high for the year. It is up 15% so far in 2023, though it has not wiped out all of the near 20% loss in 2022. Stocks and bonds in Asia rallied in response to the U.S. inflation news, while in Europe the STOXX index (.STOXX) added 0.6% to Wednesday's gains, bringing its advance for the year to around 8.6%. Market strategists at Citigroup said in a note on Thursday that slower job growth and softer-than-expected core consumer prices ""finally lend some support to the Fed’s preferred narrative that supply and demand are coming into balance, allowing inflation to cool."" Investors in Asia shook off dismal China trade data, which showed both exports and imports contracted at a worse-than-expected pace last month, betting that the latest bad news will trigger more stimulus measures. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) surged about 2%, bolstered by a 2.6% jump in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HIS) and a 1.6% gain in Australia's resources-heavy shares (.AXJO). Japan's Nikkei (.N225) rose 1.5%. The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that first-quarter global growth slightly outpaced projections in its April forecasts, but data since then has shown a mixed picture, with ""pockets of resilience"" alongside signs of slowing momentum. Bond yields were lower after a rout last week sent them sharply higher. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 3.706%, down 10.2 basis points, having dived from a seven-month top of 4.0940% on Friday. Rate-sensitive two-year yields slipped to 4.616%, down 12.6 basis points. The dollar index slumped to its lowest level since April 2022 on Thursday, as the cooling U.S. inflation bolstered expectations the Fed will rates only once more in 2023, eroding the greenback's yield advantage over peers. The euro was up 0.86% to $1.122, and the Japanese yen strengthened 0.37% versus the greenback at 137.99 per dollar. ""The market is expecting that the Fed is going to hike interest rates one more time,"" BMO Wealth Management’s chief investment officer, Yung-Yu Ma, said in an email. ""But the market does expect that that's probably where the Fed is going to stop for the rest of the year."" ""We've been thinking that the Fed's going to level off around a low 5% range and stay there for some time,"" Ma added. Oil prices traded near the highest levels in two months on the soft U.S. dollar. U.S. crude rose about 2% to $77.24 per barrel and Brent was at $81.68, also up around 2% on the day.

Brent crude futures rose $1.25, or 1.6%, to settle at $81.36 per barrel. The session peak was $81.57, the highest since April 25. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose $1.14, or 1.5%, to $76.89. The session high was $77.13, the strongest since April 26. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices rose modestly in June and registered their smallest annual increase in more than two years as inflation continued to subside. The data caused the U.S. dollar index (.DXY) to drop to the lowest since April 2022, which helped to boost oil prices, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. A weaker dollar makes crude cheaper for holders of other currencies. ""We've had very low inflation numbers today,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. Fears that the Federal Reserve was going to raise interest rates had posed a headwind to oil, he said. Markets expect just one more rate rise. Higher rates can slow economic growth and reduce oil demand. Oil prices have rallied by over 11% in two weeks, primarily in response to supply cuts from top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. The futures contract structure of the global benchmark Brent indicates the market is tightening and that OPEC could be succeeding in its mission to support the market. The premium of a front-month Brent contract to a six-month February 2024 contract rose to $2.64 a barrel on Wednesday. At the end of June, the front-month contract was at a discount to the six-month contract. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Thursday predicted oil demand would hit a record high this year, though broader economic headwinds and interest rate hikes meant the increase would be slightly less than previously anticipated. An OPEC report also published on Thursday maintained an upbeat world oil demand outlook despite economic weakness. It raised its growth forecast for 2023 and predicted only a slight slowdown in 2024, with China and India expected to keep driving the expansion in fuel use. In China, however, momentum in the post-pandemic recovery slowed, with exports contracting last month at their fastest pace since the onset of the pandemic three years ago, the country's Customs Bureau showed.","

NASA rover reveals new evidence about organic molecules on Mars,"July 14, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/nasa-rover-reveals-new-evidence-about-organic-molecules-mars-2023-07-13/,"WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) - Evidence is mounting about what may be a wealth of organic molecules - a potential indicator of life - on Mars, with new findings from NASA's Perseverance rover suggesting the presence of a diversity of them in rocks at a locale where a lake existed long ago. The latest evidence comes from an instrument called SHERLOC mounted on the six-wheeled rover's robotic arm that enables a detailed mapping and analysis of organic molecules. Researchers are reporting SHERLOC's findings from 10 places on two geological formations on the floor of Jezero crater. They obtained evidence indicating the presence of organic molecules in multiple rock samples, including some collected for potential return to Earth for future analysis. The researchers noted that evidence of such molecules is not proof of life past or present on Mars, and that non-biological processes remain a more likely explanation. ""Organics are the molecular building blocks of life as we know it, but can also be formed from geological processes not directly related to life. We see multiple signals that appear to vary across the formations of the crater floor and in the minerals they are associated with,"" said astrobiologist Sunanda Sharma of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, lead author of the research published this week in the journal Nature. Perseverance, on a mission to search for evidence of ancient life on Mars and collect samples of rock and soil for possible return to Earth, landed in February 2021 at Jezero crater, an area in the planet's northern hemisphere that once was flooded with water and home to an ancient lake basin. Mars has not always been the inhospitable place it is today, with liquid water on its surface in the distant past. Scientists suspect that microbial life once could have lived in Jezero crater. They believe river channels spilled over the crater wall and created a lake more than 3.5 billion years ago. Signals of organic molecules were detected at all 10 places that SHERLOC - short for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals - studied on the crater floor. The rocks were igneous - volcanically formed. SHERLOC employs cameras, a laser and instruments called spectrometers that analyze light wavelengths to search for organic molecules that may be signs of past microbial life. Joining the Sherlock Holmes theme, SHERLOC is assisted by WATSON, a color camera for getting close-up images of rock grains and surface textures. The researchers do not know the specific organic compounds that SHERLOC detected, but have some clues. Study co-author Ryan Roppel, a University of Pittsburgh graduate student in chemistry, said the chemical signatures could come from compounds like benzene or naphthalene. ""On Earth, these are quite common in crude oil, which has a biotic origin, but we can also form these synthetically through various chemical reactions,"" Roppel said. ""The concentrations we've detected are generally low, but we've observed signals associated with organics on nearly every rock we've sampled,"" Roppel added. Roppel said the researchers cannot rule out that inorganic - metal - sources could be responsible for the some of the signals that suggest organic molecules. Signs of organic molecules were first detected on Mars in 2015 by a different rover called Curiosity, followed by more evidence in subsequent years. With Perseverance now detecting possible signatures of organic molecules, the evidence is accumulating that organic molecules may be relatively common on Mars, though at low levels. The researchers remain cautious about the findings. ""There are both biotic and abiotic mechanisms that can form organic molecules. Interplanetary dust, infall from meteorites or water-rock interactions can produce organics abiotically,"" Roppel said. ""On the other hand, ancient life could produce these organics as well, but this is generally a last resort hypothesis. We need to rule out all abiotic mechanisms before we jump to the conclusion that any organic molecule is a sign of life.""","

California new oil well approvals have nearly ground to a halt,"July 13, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/california-new-oil-well-approvals-have-nearly-ground-halt-data-show-2023-07-13/,"July 13 (Reuters) - California, the seventh-biggest U.S. crude oil producer, has put a near halt on issuing permits for new drilling this year, according to state data. The state's Geologic Energy Management Division, known as CalGEM, has approved seven new active well permits in 2023. That compares with the more than 200 it had issued by this time last year. The stalled approvals represent the latest tension between California's bold environmental ambitions and its role as a major oil and gas producer and consumer. New drilling permits have steadily declined since Gavin Newsom became governor in 2019, but the current rate of approval represents a sudden and dramatic drop. ""It's just fallen off the cliff,"" Rock Zierman, chief executive of the California Independent Petroleum Association (CIPA), said in an interview. The industry has more than 1,400 permit applications for new wells awaiting CalGEM approval, half of which are more than a year old, he said. In an email, CalGEM attributed the smaller number of approvals to both the broader decline in California oil production and litigation that has paused permitting by Kern County, the center of the state's oil industry. CalGEM is processing far more approvals to permanently close wells than for any other activity, the agency said. ""We expect this permitting trend to continue as California transitions away from fossil fuels,"" CalGEM said. The approved new wells include one for Sentinel Peak Resources in San Luis Obispo County and five for E&B Natural Resources Management in Kern County. In an apparent concession to the oil and gas industry, approvals to improve or repair established wells are up nearly 50% to 1,650 in the first half of this year, according to an analysis of the CalGEM data by environmental group FracTracker Alliance that was provided to Reuters by the consumer advocacy non-profit Consumer Watchdog. Reworking existing wells to boost their production cannot replace volumes from new wells that are needed to meet California's energy needs, CIPA's Zierman said. The governor wants to phase out oil drilling in the state by 2045. California also passed a law last year banning oil and gas drilling within 3,200 feet of structures including homes, schools and hospitals. But CIPA has blocked implementation of that law by qualifying a referendum to overturn it for the November 2024 ballot. Nearly half of the wells with rework permits approved this year are within the contested buffer zone. Consumer Watchdog criticized those approvals as a threat to public health because they extend the lives of low- and non-producing wells, which the group argues would likely have been plugged had the setback law not been paused. “The state is simply helping the oil industry cut costs by issuing permits to tinker with unproductive wells rather than making them plug and remediate those wells that endanger the public and environment by emitting toxic compounds,"" said Liza Tucker, a consumer advocate for Consumer Watchdog. CalGEM said it is required to evaluate permits so long as the law is barred from being implemented.","

Factbox: The price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil,"July 13, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/price-cap-russian-seaborne-crude-oil-2023-07-13/,"July 13 (Reuters) - Russian Urals oil jumped $2-$3 above the $60 per barrel Western price cap on Thursday, boosted by strengthening in international benchmark Brent and additional export cuts announced by Russia in August, Reuters calculations based on traders' data showed. The Group of Seven nations, Australia and the 27 European Union countries on Dec. 5 imposed a price cap on Russian crude oil transported by ship, aiming to reduce Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine and preserve stability in the global oil market. The price cap comes on top of an EU embargo on buying seaborne Russian crude oil as a measure aimed mainly at providing third-party countries with an option to still buy it if the transaction is conducted at or below the price cap level. Below are details on how the price cap is supposed to work: The price cap was set at $60 per barrel. The level is to be reviewed every two months to ensure it stays at least 5% below the average price for Russian crude as determined by the International Energy Agency. Each change in the cap must be unanimously agreed by all 27 countries of the European Union and then by the G7. After each change of the cap there will be a 90-day grace period to make sure no ship is caught at sea with a cargo at a price that is no longer valid. G7 and EU insurance and reinsurance companies can provide services for tankers carrying Russian crude oil, and institutions can finance Russian crude transactions, provided that such cargoes are bought at or below the price cap. Shipping companies can also provide tankers for the transport of Russian crude provided the oil is sold at or below the price cap. Financial and shipping services can also be provided in an emergency and specific projects deemed essential for the energy security of certain third-party countries may be exempted from the price cap. If a third party country-flagged vessel intentionally carries Russian oil above the price cap, EU operators will be prohibited from insuring, financing or servicing the vessel for 90 days after the cargo has been unloaded. EU-flagged vessels will be subject to penalties according to national legislation, but the EU is already working on a penalty of 5% of global turnover for companies that break EU sanctions.","

Saudi Arabia imports record Russian fuel oil in June as trade grows,"July 13, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/saudi-arabia-imports-record-russian-fuel-oil-june-trade-grows-2023-07-13/,"SINGAPORE, July 13 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia imported record volumes of discounted Russian fuel oil in June, a near 10-fold annual increase to meet summer power generation demand and maintain crude exports despite OPEC+ production cuts, according to traders, analysts and Kpler data. For Russia, its growing oil trade with the world's biggest exporter enables it to keep output flowing to global buyers despite Western sanctions that have shut its access to key markets including Europe. Saudi Arabia imported a record 910,000 metric tons (193,000 barrels per day) of fuel oil from Russia in June, data from analytics firm Kpler showed. The kingdom has ramped up fuel oil imports from Russia this year following the European Union's ban on Russian products. Saudi's Russian fuel oil imports hit 2.86 million metric tons for the first half of 2023, exceeding the 1.63 million metric tons for all of 2022, the data showed. Saudi Arabia's energy ministry did not respond to a Reuters query. State oil giant Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) declined to comment. The predominantly high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) cargoes from Russia mostly end up at Saudi oil-fired power plants, said Royston Huan, fuel oil and feedstocks analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects. Saudi Arabia said this month it would extend an extra 1 million barrels per day output cut for a second month in August to support prices as part of a pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+. ""We believe there is a linkage to the cuts, as Saudi Arabia will be incentivized to prioritize their crude exports, therefore prioritizing fuel oil utilities burn over crude oil burn,"" Huan said. Traders and analysts said the OPEC kingpin has been importing cheap Russian fuel oil as well as diesel and ramping up exports in order to generate higher profits. Saudi Arabia is forecast to boost fuel oil exports to 1.2 million metric tons in July, up from 750,000 metric tons in June, Kpler data showed, as margins for the fuel strengthened. Asia's HSFO crack - the margin for refiners from producing the residue fuel from Dubai crude - is at a discount of $7.83 a barrel on Wednesday, up nearly 50% from the start of the second quarter, based on Refinitiv data. ""The recent strength in HSFO cracks were likely due to concerns of tighter HSFO availability after Saudi extended their 1 million bpd voluntary cuts,"" analysts from consultancy FGE said in an email.","

China's June crude imports soar 45.3% year over year as inventories build,"July 13, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-june-crude-imports-soar-453-previous-year-2023-07-13/,"BEIJING, July 13 (Reuters) - China's crude oil imports in June jumped 45.3% on the year to the second-highest monthly figure on record, customs data showed on Thursday, with refiners building up inventories despite tepid domestic demand. Crude imports in June totalled 52.06 million metric tons, or 12.67 million barrels per day (bpd), the data from the General Administration of Customs showed. It was a substantial increase on the 8.72 million bpd imported in June last year, when the economy was battered by widespread COVID-19 lockdowns. Crude imports also held their upward momentum on a month-on- month basis, up 4.58% from May's 12.11 million bpd. Total imports for the first half were 282.07 million metric tons, up 11.7% from 252.52 million in the corresponding period last year. Teapot refiners in the eastern province of Shandong stepped up runs as authorities lifted curbs on the import of diluted bitumen in late June, helping to ease inventory pressure at its ports. More broadly, however, inventories continue to rise against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Commodities consultancy Vortexa estimated onshore crude inventories at 980 million barrels at the end of June, just 20 million barrels below an all-time record in August 2020. While kerosene demand is up strongly on the year, boosted by a resumption in flights after the removal of curbs on travel, weakness in the manufacturing and property sectors has hurt demand for diesel, despite government stimulus measures. ""The long-haul spot barrels were booked when (arbitrage) windows were open, despite soft demand when the cargos arrived in June,"" said Emma Li, a China oil markets analyst at Vortexa in Singapore. China imported 10.39 million metric tons of natural gas in June, up 19.2% from 8.72 million a year ago when importers cut spot purchases amid high global liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices. Total gas imports for the first half stood at 56.63 million metric tons, a 5.8% increase on last year. Refined fuel exports rose 40.6% to 4.51 million metric tons from 3.21 million in June last year, but down from the previous month's 4.89 million metric tons.","

Column: Saudi output cut removes downside risk from oil market,"July 13, 2023",https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/saudi-output-cut-removes-downside-risk-oil-market-kemp-2023-07-12/,"LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Extra crude production cuts announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia have removed some downside risk and stemmed the erosion of the spot prices and calendar spreads evident since early in the second quarter. On July 3, Saudi Arabia announced that it would extend its cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the month of July to August as well, while Russia announced a new cut of 0.5 million bpd for August. If the cuts are implemented in full, they will reduce global production and expected inventories by as much as 45 million barrels by the end of August, on top of the 30 million Saudi Arabia is already removing in July. The production cuts would reverse the previous accumulation of inventories, where commercial stocks held in the advanced economies increased by 75 million barrels in the first five months of 2023. In the financial market, the announcement has lifted front-month futures prices to more than $79 per barrel (48th percentile for all trading days since 2000) up from a recent low of less than $73 (40th percentile) on June 27. Benchmark prices are now in line with their long-term average since the start of the century once inflation is taken into account, consistent with a market expected to be close to balance through the end of 2023. The biggest increases have come at the front end of the curve as the march from backwardation to a contango structure evident over the last two months has been partially reversed. Brent's calendar spread for the fourth quarter reverted to a backwardation of almost $1.20 per barrel on July 11 up from just 4 cents on June 27. The six-month spread tightened to a backwardation of more than $2.30 (73rd percentile for all trading days since 2000) up from just 8 cents (42nd percentile) on June 27. Chartbook: Brent prices and spreads In the physical market, the same moderate tightening is evident in spreads for dated Brent barrels with delivery dates between August and October. The front-month spread (from August to September) and second-month spread (September to October) are both trading around the 75th percentile. From a fundamental perspective, the production cuts announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia are expected to remove excess barrels from the market. They will help counter weaker-than-anticipated economic growth and petroleum consumption from North America, Europe and China in the third quarter. From a positioning and sentiment perspective, they are also helping counter the buildup of an unusually large number of bearish short positions and giving more inspiration to fund managers trying to become bullish. The total number of hedge fund short positions across Brent and WTI had reached 239 million barrels by the end of June, up from less than 100 million throughout most of April. The number of fund short positions was the largest since November 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was still raging. Futures buying to cover existing bearish short positions and establish new bullish long positions has helped lift prices. Since most fund positions are concentrated in nearby months, where liquidity and volatility are greatest, the wave of buying has accelerated the return to a backwardation structure. Following the announcement, oil traders expect the production-consumption-inventory balance to be moderately tight for the remainder of 2023, assuming global economic growth remains tepid. If growth accelerates again, the market will tighten rapidly, implying a rapid escalation of prices and spreads in the final part of the year. The exceptionally low level of hedge fund positions in crude means there is plenty of scope for position-building to anticipate, accelerate and amplify the move. The combined net position of 258 million barrels on July 3-4 was still in only the 6th percentile for all weeks since 2013 (the 50th percentile would be a position of around 484 million barrels). If growth remains anaemic, however, Saudi Arabia and Russia will come under pressure to extend the cuts into September and beyond to prevent prices and spreads retreating again.
