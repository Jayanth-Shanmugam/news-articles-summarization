Govt launches digital crop survey in 12 States to create data on cultivation.,"August 02, 2023",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/govt-launches-digital-crop-survey-in-12-states-to-create-data-on-cultivation/article67146208.ece,"The Centre has launched a pilot project on Digital Crop Survey (DCS) in 12 States from the Kharif season this year to create a single and verified source on crop cultivation data.In a written reply in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Narendra Singh Tomar, Union Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Minister, said the DCS reference application has been developed as an open source, open standard, and inter-operable public good. Geo-referenced cadastral maps with Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies are used to ensure the farmland position.Some of the States selected for the pilot on DCS include Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Assam.The States have been selected based on the preparedness in respect of pre-requisite criteria for DCS such as geo-referencing of village maps and digitised Record of Right (RoR) with ownership extent.'The project aims are to create a single and verified source of truth about the 'crop sown data' which is useful for accurate crop area estimation and development of various farmers centric solutions,' he said.The statement assumes significance in the wake of the country facing wheat and rice supply shortage despite estimates of record production.To a separate query on the impact of climate change on crop yields, the Minister said rainfed rice, wheat, kharif maize, and mustard are the most vulnerable crops to climate change.Referring to ICAR’s network project on National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), he said the projected reduction in crop yield could be 20 per cent and 47 per cent, respectively, by 2050 and 2080 for rain-fed rice.The projected reduction in crop yield could be 19.3 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, by 2050 and 2080, for wheat; and 18 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, by 2050 and 2080 for kharif maize.Mustard’s crop yield is expected to come down by 7.9 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, by 2050 and 2080.Following the framework of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), ICAR has carried out the climate vulnerability analysis and identified 109 districts in the ‘very high’ risk category and 201 districts in ‘high’ risk category under ICAR’s network project on NICRA.Responding to a question by one of the members, Tomar gave data on the requirement and availability of certified/quality seeds in the country. While the requirement of certified/quality seeds was 464.14 lakh quintals for 2022-23, the availability was at 514.26 lakh quintals, he said.Mango productionTo another question, he said the production of mango has increased by 12.7 per cent over the last 10 years from 184.31 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2013-14 to 207.7 lt in 2022-23 (first advance estimates).Quoting the reports received from the States, he said the production of mango and its quality have been adversely affected in the current year due to unseasonal rains, thunder, hailstorms, pest infestation, etc.To a separate query on the spending by the Government on agriculture and farmers, Tomar said the Government spent Rs.6.48 lakh crore during 2022-23. The expenditures included around Rs.2.25 lakh crore on fertilizer subsidy, Rs.2.87 lakh crore on food subsidy, Rs.76,279 crore on agriculture and allied activities (excluding PM-KISAN), and Rs.60,000 crore on PM-KISAN.",2023-08-02 20:43:56.958806,"

'India should prepare its exporters to deal with compliance norms of EU's deforestation regulation'.,"August 02, 2023",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-should-prepare-its-exporters-to-deal-with-compliance-norms-of-eus-deforestation-regulation/articleshow/102309178.cms,"India should take measures such as increasing awareness among exporters and proper implementation of track and trace systems to deal with compliance requirements of the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) as it would hit agri exports, a report said on Tuesday.This regulation will hit India's agricultural exports worth USD 1.3 billion to the EU starting December 2024, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.'Indian exports may take a bigger hit than exports from other competing countries to the EU because of India's higher deforestation rate,' the report said, adding India's exports will also be affected by the complex compliance requirements of the EUDR and the EU's Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR).Even if the exporter is certain that a product is not grown on the deforested land, he/she still has to follow all elaborate compliance requirements, GTRI Co-founder Ajay Srivastava said.He said this is so different from quality standards where quality of the final product alone matters.'The EU just wants to raise the cost of imports to help local producers through a complex compliance mechanism,' he added.The key products which would be affected due to this regulation include coffee, leather hides, skin, preparations, oil cake, paper, paperboard, and wood furniture.The European Union Deforestation-Free Products Regulation, also known as EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) was adopted by the European Union Council, on May 16, 2023.The regulation requires firms to ensure that the product exported to the EU has been grown on land which has not been deforested after December 31, 2020.'The regulation is not WTO (World Trade Organization) compatible and a non-tariff barrier,' the report said.The new rules will apply to large firms with effect from December 2024 and small firms from June 2025.The regulation prescribes fines up to 4 per cent of a firm's annual turnover in the EU, confiscation of product, confiscation of revenues gained from a transaction.Citing a March 2023 report by 'Utility Bidder', GTRI said that India lost a significant amount of forest between 1990 and 2020, making it the second-worst country after Brazil in terms of forest loss during 2015-2020.'India lost 384,000 ha of forests between 1990 and 2000, and 668,400 ha between 2015 and 2020. However, the India State of Forest Report 2021, released in January claimed a small increase in forest cover. But the positive picture is because the government doesn't distinguish between natural forests and plantations when assessing forest cover. India is losing its natural forests and replacing them with plantations,' it said.Due to this situation, Indian exporters will face challenges as they must prove that their export products come from land that has not been deforested after December 31, 2020, it said adding the EUDR will consider plantation land as deforested land, which would add to the difficulties for Indian exporters.'The EUDR makes exports expensive due to the high compliance cost. Even exporters of high-quality products must invest in expensive due diligence. They need to prove the integrity of their supply chain through a detailed trace and track system from Indian farms to EU markets. This involves sharing farm and farmer data with the EU,' it said.The compliance procedure includes collecting various information such as commodity details, quantity, farmer/supplier names, country of production, and addresses of the land plots where the commodities were produced.It said that the Indian government should acknowledge that the EUDR is a reality and it should not expect any exemptions from the EU.The government should 'join hands with other affected countries to raise the issue at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Raise awareness among exporters about the compliance requirements; and utilize the existing blockchain-enabled trace and track system implemented by APEDA for grape exports to the EU and extend its adoption to cover all relevant products,' the report suggested.Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) is an arm of the commerce ministry which deals with agri exports.",2023-08-02 20:43:56.958806,"

"Indian rice exporters body seeks different HSN code for Sona Masuri variety, floor price.","August 02, 2023",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/indian-rice-exporters-body-seeks-different-hsn-code-for-sona-masur-variety-floor-price/article67145583.ece,"The Rice Exporters Association (TREA) has urged Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to allow the export of Sona Masuri variety white rice under a different harmonized system of nomenclature (HSN) code besides fixing a minimum export price (MEP) of $1,000 a tonne.In a letter to Goyal, TREA President BV Krishna Rao said the July 20 ban on the export of white rice from the country will result in the shipments of the cereals dropping to 10 million tonnes (mt) from 17.29 mt of non-basmati white, parboiled and broken rice exported in 2022-23.Since Sona Masuri falls under the white rice category, the export ban applies to the variety. 'We request for HSN code differentiation for Sona Masuri to support the Indian diaspora who require rice urgently,' Rao said in his letter.While fixing an MEP of $1,000/tonne, the Centre could also fix an export cap of 1 mt. This will help the government accommodate the diaspora supporting the country in all respects, the TREA president said.Rao sought transitional arrangements for exporters who have letters of credit (LoC) so that they can be saved from international arbitration.'Many exporters have export contracts and white rice stocks which are verifiable need to be allowed (to be shipped,' he said.Any further ban will damage the country’s reputation abroad and take a long time to restore the markets.The Centre should review the ban once rice prices are under control and rainfall improves since African nations and the Indian diaspora are the main consumers, he said.The Centre banned white rice exports on July 20 as its prices began to rise in the country following a shortage of paddy, and the area under paddy cultivation lagged due to deficient rains in the growing regions.As of July 28, the coverage of paddy was 4.23 lakh hectares (lh) higher at 237.58 lh, but the area is lower in key States such as Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.Rice stocks, as of July 1, were at a six-year low of 25.35 mt. Besides, the Food Corporation of India held 29.3 mt of unmilled paddy (19;63 mt rice).The Centre banned the export of white rice as its measures to curb shipments last year by imposing a 20 per cent export duty did not yield the desired results. Exports increased despite the duty, and this year, monthly shipments exceeded 5 lakh tonnes from 4 lakh tonnes a year ago.Besides, according to analysts, rice prices in the global market soared to a five-year high forcing India to take measures to protect its food security, according to analysts.",2023-08-02 20:43:56.958806,"

So, if a dispute arises, they are obligated to arbitrate rather than pursue traditional court litigation.Sona Masoori non-basmati rice is popular in the African nations and among the Indian diaspora in the US and Europe, and the government should look into the matter, Rice Exporters Association president BV Krishna Rao said.'We have written to the commerce ministry on this and have also informed them that any further ban can damage India's image in the global markets and it will take a long time to restore the markets, where we have penetrated. We have urged the government to provide a transitional arrangement for the exporters to ship the rice to these destinations,' Rao said.Rice exporters are flooded with calls from the Indian diaspora living in the US, UK and Africa for Indian non-basmati Sona Masoori rice whose price has doubled in the global markets since India imposed the ban.In the US, the price of 20 pounds of rice (9 kg) has increased to $49 (Rs 4,030) from $16, according to Rao and media reports.India is the largest exporter of non-basmati rice with a 45% market share globally. In fiscal 2023, it exported 14.24 million tonnes of non-basmati rice.

Kerala to cash in on Centre’s affinity for millets.,"August 02, 2023",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/kerala-to-cash-in-on-centres-affinity-for-millets/article67145088.ece,"The Centre’s initiative to popularise the growing of millets has spurred Kerala to raise its millet acreage in Attapadi, the only tribal taluk in Palakkad district.The plan is to enhance the area of cultivation under the Attapadi Millet Village project to 3,000 hectares from the present 1,200 hectares. 'We would be able to achieve the target as the yield in the first crop season in April-May-June planting is encouraging with an expected production of 520 tonnes vis-a-vis 720 tonnes in the two crop season last year,' R. Latha, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Attapadi told businessline.The Kerala government had started the Millet Village project among the tribes in Attapadi in 2017 by focussing on their health and livelihood aspects. It commenced much before India declared 2018 as the year of millets and the UN declared the International Year of Millets in 2023.Because of the traditional crop, Latha said the productivity was comparatively less due to lack of intense cultivation practices. Besides, the threat of wild animals also forced farmers to abandon the crop. The availability of essential commodities to tribals through the Public Distribution System was also a contributing factor for farmers losing interest in millet cultivation.Measures to encourageHowever, the government has come up with measures with subsidies to encourage millet farming by protecting farmlands through the installation of fences like electronic, beehive, solar, etc to scare away animals. This has encouraged farmers to take up cultivation.Kerala’s procurement price of millets is also the highest in the country at Rs.40 per kg compared to Rs.25 in other states. The produce from organic farms fetches a price tag of Rs.60.Currently, 192 tribal settlements are engaged in millet farming in Attapadi spearheaded by both State Agriculture Department as well as the Scheduled Tribes Department producing ragi, little millet (chama), barn-yard millet, fox tail millet, proso millet, sorghum, bajra, etc. Around 740 hectares of farm lands in 40 hamlets received organic certification which would be a major boost as they received higher prices, she said.Since the present tribal farmers are getting old, Latha emphasised the need to woo younger generations into millet farming by making them familiar with value addition to earn more revenue. Today, the first priority of the yield is to address the nutritional needs of tribal people and the rest goes to the retail market.Aimed at the export promotion of millets, Palakkad district administration conducts classes to familiarise various activities related to the shipping of products. It is also organising expos, distributing millet seeds to students to start farming at school levels. Atfam, the FPO, is also gearing up for exports on robust enquires, especially from Europe.The Technopark-based UST and NGOs such as Thanal and Pan India jointly set up a millet processing unit in Agali town, which would benefit farmers in five tribal hamlets to avoid long distance travel for processing.",2023-08-02 20:43:56.958806,"
