"Hopeful of finalising certain FTAs in next few months, says Piyush Goyal.","August 01, 2023",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/hopeful-of-finalising-certain-ftas-in-next-few-months-says-piyush-goyal/articleshow/102236261.cms,"
	Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said he is hopeful of India finalising certain free trade agreements (FTAs) in the next few months, which would help promote exports. India is in the final stages of concluding FTA negotiations with the UK. The country is also negotiating similar pacts with Canada and European Union (EU).
	 
	'We can leverage the free trade agreements with the UAE and Australia and we are hopeful that in the next few months, we will finalise many more free trade agreements to help you grow your business with zero duty on finished leather products and footwear available for you to exploit bigger and better markets,' Goyal said while addressing footwear industry representatives here.
	 
	The minister also asked the industry to focus on quality and sustainable manufacturing processes to tap business opportunities in the developed world.
	 
	The Indian footwear and leather industry is not only a major foreign exchange earner but being a labour-intensive sector, it also provides employment to approximately 4.5 million people, 40 per cent of whom are women.
	 
	He said that India has the capacity to become the world's largest and best-quality footwear manufacturer.
	 
	India is the second largest exporter of leather garments, third-largest exporter of saddlery and harnesses and fourth-largest exporter of leather goods in the world.
	 
	More than 95 per cent of the production units in this sector are micro, small & medium enterprises (MSME) units.
	 
	Further Goyal said that Indian size of footwear will be launched soon to help distinguish Indian footwear around the globe and reduce dependence on foreign sizing trends.
	 
	He suggested industrialists explore FTAs for technological collaborations, joint ventures of non-leather footwear, thus increasing the export of the country and enhancing the domestic market with Indian products.
	 
	Goyal highlighted the beauty of Kolhapuri footwear of Maharashtra and Mojari footwear of Rajasthan, stating that it should be an area of attraction for international buyers as well.
	 
	Talking about quality, he said the government has issued quality control norms for the sector and the government is ready to set up testing facilities for certifications.
	 
	Goyal urged the stakeholders to expand the business while keeping the focus on quality and sustainability, eco-friendly process, waste management, and exploring renewable sources for electricity.
	 
	Not only do we need to enhance our design capabilities to move up the value chain, but also bring in more investments and technology to scale up the production and produce innovative products, he added.",2023-08-01 11:36:33.747237,"

Singapore in close contact with Indian authorities to seek exemption from non-basmati rice export ban.,"August 01, 2023",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/singapore-in-close-contact-with-indian-authorities-to-seek-exemption-from-non-basmati-rice-export-ban/articleshow/102198174.cms,"
	Singapore is in close contact with Indian authorities to seek exemption from the country's ban on export of non-basmati rice, the city state's food agency said on Friday. 'Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is working closely with importers to increase the import of different varieties of rice from various sources. Singapore is also in close contact with the Indian authorities to seek exemption from the ban,' said a statement from SFA.
	 
	On July 20, the Indian government banned exports of non-basmati white rice to boost domestic supply and keep retail prices under check during the upcoming festive season. Non-basmati white rice constitutes about 25 per cent of total rice exported from the country.
	 
	In 2022, India accounted for about 40 per cent of Singapore's imported rice, said the agency. Singapore imports rice from more than 30 countries.
	 
	 
	Under Singapore's Rice Stockpile Scheme, rice importers must hold a buffer inventory equivalent to twice of their monthly imports. This helps ensure an adequate supply of rice in the market, SFA said in a statement.
	 
	Countries expected to be hit by the ban include African nations, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, among others.
	 
	In the first quarter of the current fiscal, about 15.54 lakh tonnes of white rice was exported from India against only 11.55 lakh tonne in the year-ago period, which means an increase by 35 per cent.

Meghalaya exporting over 1.3 tonnes of Pineapples to the Middle East.,"August 01, 2023",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/meghalaya-exporting-over-1-3-tonnes-of-pineapples-to-the-middle-east/articleshow/102236027.cms,"
	Meghalaya exporting over 1.3 tonnes of Pineapples to the Middle East.
	 
	To further promote and build the market for Meghalaya’s pineapples, the government is organising a Pineapple festival in Delhi. The festival will be held post the celebrations of Independence Day.
	 
	Following on the successful export of Khasi mandarin last year, the Department of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare, Government of Meghalaya and Meghalaya Basin Management Agency (MBMA) has recently facilitated market linkages of over 1.3 tonnes of Pineapples to the Middle East.
	 
	This is part of the continued efforts to reduce the gulf between the farmers of the state and lucrative international markets. The pineapples from Meghalaya are being sold across malls in Dubai, Kuwait and Sharjah, but more importantly the farmers are enjoying the fruit of their labour with up to two times increase in price realisation from these trades.
	 
	The efforts closer home has resulted in sustained market linkages with domestic processors and retailers. Last year, over 40 tonnes of pineapples were shipped to a Karnataka based processor to be further exported to European and North American markets. This year, the same processor has established a mobile processing unit at Umdihar IVCS, in Umdihar Village (Ri Bhoi) for taking in larger quantities and over 23 tonnes of Pineapples have been processed by the unit in the first week of its operation.
	 
	The processing units require pineapples weighing a kilogram and above and don’t accept fruits of smaller sizes. During harvest season, entire fields are harvested for sale, but only the large pineapples (Grade A) get sold to the processing units. This leaves the farmers with a large quantity of smaller sized pineapples (Grade B aka table variety). Since the ripening accelerates post-harvest, these table-variety pineapples are often sold at throw away prices.
	 
	To mitigate distress sale of these table-variety pineapples, the department is actively exploring market linkages with local retailers and have recently established linkages with Reliance Retail stores across Guwahati for sale of table-variety pineapples from Meghalaya. As a result of this intervention the farmers are now able to get over 2 times the price for the table-variety pineapples.
	 
	The Meghalaya pineapples are famous for their high-sugar content (brix value of 16-18) and low sourness. The pineapples in the State are mostly being cultivated without any use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in significantly lower heavy metal and pesticide residue in the fruit. These traits make them highly suitable for lucrative international and national markets.
	 
	However, for long the trade has been dominated by middlemen and traders who often ‘book bagaans’ (farm fields) months before harvest season by paying the farmers a lumpsum amount. The farmers, having poor access to market information and needing money before the festive season and onset of school semester, unwillingly ‘book’ their farms at a fraction of the cost of the fruits on their farm.
	 
	The government has been actively working towards building community-centric, grassroots level solutions. These efforts are slowly coming to fruition now. The government has been working towards mobilising the farmers to form farmer cooperatives and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) across the state and over 350 such collectives have been formed in the last 3 years.
	 
	The Department and MBMA have been hand-holding these collectives so that they are able to replace the middlemen and transition to better production and marketing. For instance, the recent consignment of over 1.3 tonnes of Pineapples shipped to Middle East was undertaken by the ‘Silchang Dimrimbri Palwa Adling IVCS’ of East Garo Hills District. This was the first time that the farmer collective had undertaken an international trade and this was only made possible by the active support of the Department and MBMA.
	 
	Dr. Vijay Kumar D, Commissioner and Secretary, Government of Meghalaya, stated, 'We are delighted to witness the remarkable success of our pineapple growers in Meghalaya, who have embraced prosperity through their hard work and dedication. The recent market linkages to the Middle East and domestic processors are a testament to the immense potential of our state's pineapples in the international and national markets. The surge in price realization and the establishment of market connections have not only elevated our farmers' livelihoods but have also showcased the superior quality of Meghalaya's pineapples with their exceptional sweetness and low sourness. Government of Meghalaya recognized the challenges faced by our farmers in the past, and it has been our earnest endeavor to empower them with community-centric solutions. The formation of farmer cooperatives and producer organizations has proven instrumental in reducing reliance on middlemen and traders, enabling our farmers to receive fair value for their produce. The forthcoming Pineapple festival in Delhi is yet another significant step towards promoting our exquisite 'fineapples' and strengthening their presence in the national market. We extend our gratitude to the Department of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare, as well as the Meghalaya Basin Management Agency, for their unwavering support in realizing these achievements. As we continue to foster sustainable growth in the agricultural sector, we envision a brighter and more prosperous future for our farmers and the state of Meghalaya as a whole. Together, we shall cultivate success and sweetness in every step of this journey.'",2023-08-01 11:36:33.747237,"

	Indian farmers have planted 23.7 million hectares with summer-sown rice so far, according to the farm ministry's latest data, up 1.71% year-on-year, as crucial monsoon rains revived in July and helped farmers accelerate sowing.
	 
	Higher rice planting in India, the world's second biggest producer of the grain, will ease concerns about the lower output of the staple.
	 
	Earlier this month, India ordered a halt to its largest rice export category - a move that will roughly halve shipments by the world's largest exporter of the grain.
	 
	Farmers typically start planting rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, sugarcane and peanuts, among other crops, from June 1, when monsoon rains are expected to begin drenching India. Sowing usually lasts until July and early August.
	 
	Summer rains are crucial as nearly half of India's farmland lacks irrigation.
	 
	India received 10% below normal rains in June, but in some states, the rainfall deficit was as much as 60% below average.

Millet momentum. Technology to be a game-changer for India’s millet revolution.,"August 01, 2023",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/technology-to-be-a-game-changer-for-indias-millet-revolution/article67138115.ece,"
	In 2023, the United Nations recognised the 'International Year of Millets', marking a significant milestone that positively impacted the global millet value chain. This declaration ignited a renewed focus on cultivating and consuming millets, generating a powerful momentum. Acknowledging the importance of this grain, the Indian government renamed millets 'Shree Anna,' symbolising its deep connection to Carnatic culture, and is actively implementing initiatives to promote millet cultivation and consumption throughout the country.
	 
	However, despite these promising advancements, many marginalised farmers who operate small independent farms, especially in the southern region of India have been unable to reap the benefits. Their lack of awareness, skills, market connections, and restricted access to modern agricultural technology have impeded their productivity and profitability.
	 
	Technology will play a crucial role in addressing these challenges and transforming the millet food system into a sustainable model that supports rural livelihoods. Enhancing accessibility, raising awareness about the advantages of millet farming, and establishing market linkages are all vital components of this transformation. Ensuring digital inclusion for local farmers and actively involving the younger generation, particularly students, as essential stakeholders are pivotal steps in this direction.
	 
	New agricultural methods
	The existing differences in millet farming practices across regions provide interesting opportunities for technological intervention and knowledge sharing. For example, in Andhra Pradesh, crops are grown with closer spacing, whereas wider spacing is recommended in Kerala. By creating awareness about these new techniques, farmers can optimise their own agricultural methods to maximise productivity.
	 
	Integrating technology into farming processes can help automate labor-intensive tasks like processing, relieving farmers of some of their workload and allowing them to allocate time to other vital activities. In addition, technology intervention provides farmers and the local community with a broader market reach, establishing connections with potential buyers, guaranteeing fair prices, and promoting sustainable growth while alleviating the issue of the 'digital divide.'
	 
	Investing in technological advancements
	In rural areas, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and various corporate initiatives are driving progress by providing essential training to farmers and enabling them to utilise technology effectively. Recognising the potential for significant advancements in the agricultural sector, there is a growing emphasis on investing in technology within agricultural colleges. These colleges benefit farmers directly but also serve as incubators for small-scale agri-businesses led by enthusiastic young volunteers and students. Their collaboration with partners involves conducting in-depth analyses of the local millet food system and developing prototypes that promote sustainable farming practices for millet cultivation.
	 
	Encouraging student involvement through technology
	A remarkable shift is taking place as stakeholders embrace the renewed interest in millet cultivation, marking a commitment to a second agricultural revolution. Let’s consider the College of Applied Science IHRD, in Kerala. A significant number of students at this college hail from farming backgrounds and are often the first in their families to pursue higher education. Driven by their deep-rooted passion for agriculture and a desire to make a meaningful impact in their communities, these students are working with corporates like Lenovo on projects like Work for Humankind and helping promote millet cultivation using technology. Such an environment fosters innovation, creativity, and an entrepreneurial mindset among students. This ensures that the knowledge gained from their endeavours is theoretical and practically applied, yielding enduring positive changes.
	 
	The revival of millets and the sustainable development of agriculture hinge upon embracing technology-driven initiatives as a powerful force for change. To achieve this, we must disseminate knowledge of innovative farming practices, invest in technology for farmers and agricultural colleges, and inspire and support students. However, it is essential for corporations and government policies to play their part in creating an enabling ecosystem that nurtures and encourages young students to pursue careers in agriculture. By fostering collaboration among local stakeholders, academia, and policymakers, we can pave the way for a prosperous future where the fusion of technology and agriculture drives the revival of millets, ensuring a resilient and thriving society for the betterment of humankind.",2023-08-01 11:36:33.747237,"
