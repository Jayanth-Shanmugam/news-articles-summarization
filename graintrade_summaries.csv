State agency Malaysian Palm Oil Board (PBOB) said crude palm oil prices in Malaysia in the second half of 2023 will be 3,700-4,200 ringgit/t and will be supportive in the long term. However, there is a possibility that prices could rise to RM4,300/t or $952/t and above ahead of 2024 amid uncertainty over Black Sea sunflower oil supplies and lower-than-expected palm oil production in Malaysia. In the first half of 2023, palm oil production in Malaysia (the world's second largest producer) decreased by almost 3% compared to the same period in 2022. By December 2023, the world's largest buyers, India and China, will collectively import 16.5 million tons of palm oil, compared to 15 million tons in 2022. ""There will be an increased demand for palm oil in the ASEAN and MENA regions as a result of the competitive price for it and the shortage of domestic production,"" MROS experts predict.

The European Commission is coordinating work with Romania and Ukraine on the activation of shipments. There are two entrances/exits to the Danube: Sulina and Bystre mouth. Currently, the European Commission has allocated funds for navigation equipment that will speed up navigation along Sulina. In addition, Romania is training additional pilots who will start working as early as August, which will allow the channel to operate 24 hours a day. Therefore, already in September, we can expect an increase in exports to 3 million tons. To increase throughput, Ukraine is negotiating anchorages where ships could be loaded. At the meeting with the European Commission, the Minister of Transport of Romania confirmed the creation of an anchorage in the port of Constanţa, where they will be able to load 5 ships (three Handysize size of 25-27 thousand tons and two Panamax class up to 70 thousand tons). It will become operational at the end of August and will increase the turnover of river terminals and barges on the Danube. If barges are now arriving at Constanta and waiting for a vessel moored at the quay, in the future, ships will be loaded at anchor, which will increase the port's capacity. At the same time, the organization of the parking lot does not require investments, but only the relevant permit documentation. Unfortunately, the port of Constanta is unable to handle large volumes of Ukrainian grain. Under ideal weather conditions, its carrying capacity is 30 million tons, but last year they set a record by transferring 25 million tons of grain. Even if transshipment volumes increase by another 1-2 million tons, it will not solve the problem of Ukraine, which plans to export 40-50 million tons of grain, says UZA. Also, Ukraine plans to create anchorages in the territorial waters of Romania at the exit from Sulina, which will reduce the distance to the ports, speed up the turnover of barges and increase the volume of exports to 3.5-4 million tons per month. This would make it possible to use the terminals of Romania (Galatz) and Moldova (Giurgiulesti). It takes about 3 months to create such parking lots, UZA said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania confirmed the country's plans to increase the carrying capacity of the Danube canals and the number of ship captains from 40 to 60 people, involving retired and military personnel to speed up transit through the Danube canals, open new checkpoints on the border with Ukraine, and increase the number of personnel at existing checkpoints.

In the Southern and Central plains, the heat will remain at 35-37 o C during the week, which will intensify dry conditions in some areas. But there will also be scattered rains next week. Rainfall in drought-stricken northern areas will reduce the effects of the heat and replenish moisture reserves. But stress on spring wheat and soybean crops will remain, which could reduce yield potential. In some areas of the Canadian prairies, a cold front will bring precipitation in the next few days. Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan are suffering from drought, but after the weekend there will also be rain that will improve moisture reserves in the wheat and canola crops that are in the pouring stage. A major cyclone will move across Europe from north to south for 10 days, reducing the heat in the south and improving the prospects for late crop harvests, although it will delay the harvest of wheat, barley and canola. In the Black Sea region, especially in Ukraine, short-term rains and variable temperatures are expected next week, favorable for the cultivation of corn and sunflower. But in the west and in the center of Ukraine, rains during wheat harvesting have worsened the quality of grain, so the share of food wheat will decrease to 10-30% compared to 60-70% in recent years. It is worth noting that the yield of wheat and rape is higher than last year. The harvesting of corn in Brazil and Argentina is delayed, which plays into the hands of exporters from Ukraine and the USA. According to the agency Conab, as of July 22, corn of the second harvest in Brazil has been harvested in 48% of the area (60% last year) due to the lack of free containers for grain storage in some regions due to the too slow shipment of soybeans. According to the BAGE exchange, in Argentina, corn has been harvested on 68.4% of the area (only +2.3% for the week) due to long rains.",2023-08-02 20:44:14.156146,"

Traders are concerned about the hot weather that has prevailed this week in the growing regions of corn, soybeans and spring wheat in the US, but forecasts of precipitation and lower temperatures in the next 7-10 days keep prices from speculative growth. In the Midwest of the USA, the heat will remain at 35-37 o C for another 2-3 days, which will negatively affect the planting of soybeans and corn, but already next week, scattered precipitation will lower the temperature to 28-30 o C and stress the plants.

Egypt bought sunflower oil for $154/t more than in the previous tender,"

Therefore, traders closely followed the results of the Egyptian food procurement tender, which became an indicator of price trends. On July 26, the state-owned Egyptian operator GASC purchased 45,000 tons of vegetable oils, including 33,000 tons of sunflower oil, at a price of $1,080/t C&F in the following batches at an international tender: 12 thousand tons at TOI Commodities with delivery on August 6-20, 10,000 tons at Oliva AD with delivery on August 6-20, 5.5 thousand t in the company Aston Agro Industrial with delivery on August 6-20, 5.5 thousand t at the company Aston Agro Industrial with delivery from August 20 to September 5. In addition, 11,875 thousand tons of soybean oil were purchased from LDC at a price of $1,150,1080/t C&F for delivery from August 20 to September 5. The purchase price of sunflower oil was $154/t, and soybean oil - $102/t higher than at the previous tender on June 13. And the volume of purchased oil tripled, which indicates that GASC's expectations for a price reduction on the eve of the new season were not met. The number of tender applications has also increased. Thus, GASC received 6 offers of sunflower oil at a price of $1,114-1,196/t, and 8 offers of soybean oil at a price of $1,200-1,259/t. High prices for soybean and sunflower oil are due to a reduction in supplies from Ukraine, the USA and Argentina against the background of a decrease in soybean and sunflower stocks and a decrease in forecasts for the soybean harvest in the US in the new season. Yesterday on the exchange in Chicago, September soybean oil futures fell by 1.8% to $1,450/t (after a week's increase of 10%), and December - by 1.8% to $1,370/t (+11, 9% per month).",2023-08-02 20:44:14.156146,"
