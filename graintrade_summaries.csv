During the week, November rapeseed futures on Paris Euronext fell 4.7% to €458.75/t, or $505/t, adding 4.7% to prices for the month on forecasts of production cuts. If last week the quotations fell under the pressure of increased offers, especially from Ukraine, as a result of harvesting, then this week prices will be affected by forecasts of a decrease in the harvest in the EU. The experts of the European Commission reduced the forecast of the rape crop in the EU in 2023 from 19.9 to almost last year's level of 19.4 million tons, although back in June they estimated it at 20.7 million tons. At the same time, the forecast of rapeseed imports to the EU in 2023/24 was left at the level of 5.8 million tons compared to 7.2 million tons in 2022/23 MR. November canola futures on the Winnipeg exchange last week fell 2% to CAD 809/t, or $610/t, adding 10% for the month amid a lack of rainfall in the southern Canadian prairies. No precipitation is expected in Saskatchewan and Alberta over the next 7-10 days, although canola crops are in bulk, which could reduce yield potential and increase speculative price pressure. In Ukraine, as of July 28, from 931.3 thousand hectares or 65% of the area, 2.498 million tons of rapeseed were threshed with a yield of 2.68 tons/ha (2.56 tons/ha last year). Precipitation is expected in the coming days, especially in the western regions, which will delay harvesting and reduce productivity, although for now production forecasts remain at the level of 3.8-4 million tons. Purchase prices for rapeseed at the end of the week rose to $370-375/t or UAH 14,800-15,300/t with delivery to Danube ports, but traders are restraining purchases against the backdrop of rising freight rates from Danube ports to Constanta and lower world prices.

Ukraine is increasing the volume of shipments through the Danube ports, and in July it already exported 720,000 tons of wheat compared to 325,000 tons last year. UZA experts believe that with the help of Romania, it will be possible to increase the export of grain through the Danube ports from the current 2 million tons to 3-3.5 million tons. The rains are delaying the harvesting of wheat, which as of July 28, from 1.816 million hectares or 43% of the area, 8.06 million tons were threshed with a yield of 4.44 tons/ha (last year at this time, 8 million tons of wheat were harvested from 2.3 million hectares) .

The European Commission is coordinating work with Romania and Ukraine on the activation of shipments. There are two entrances/exits to the Danube: Sulina and Bystre mouth. Currently, the European Commission has allocated funds for navigation equipment that will speed up navigation along Sulina. In addition, Romania is training additional pilots who will start working as early as August, which will allow the channel to operate 24 hours a day. Therefore, already in September, we can expect an increase in exports to 3 million tons. To increase throughput, Ukraine is negotiating anchorages where ships could be loaded. At the meeting with the European Commission, the Minister of Transport of Romania confirmed the creation of an anchorage in the port of Constanţa, where they will be able to load 5 ships (three Handysize size of 25-27 thousand tons and two Panamax class up to 70 thousand tons). It will become operational at the end of August and will increase the turnover of river terminals and barges on the Danube. If barges are now arriving at Constanta and waiting for a vessel moored at the quay, in the future, ships will be loaded at anchor, which will increase the port's capacity. At the same time, the organization of the parking lot does not require investments, but only the relevant permit documentation. Unfortunately, the port of Constanta is unable to handle large volumes of Ukrainian grain. Under ideal weather conditions, its carrying capacity is 30 million tons, but last year they set a record by transferring 25 million tons of grain. Even if transshipment volumes increase by another 1-2 million tons, it will not solve the problem of Ukraine, which plans to export 40-50 million tons of grain, says UZA. Also, Ukraine plans to create anchorages in the territorial waters of Romania at the exit from Sulina, which will reduce the distance to the ports, speed up the turnover of barges and increase the volume of exports to 3.5-4 million tons per month. This would make it possible to use the terminals of Romania (Galatz) and Moldova (Giurgiulesti). It takes about 3 months to create such parking lots, UZA said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania confirmed the country's plans to increase the carrying capacity of the Danube canals and the number of ship captains from 40 to 60 people, involving retired and military personnel to speed up transit through the Danube canals, open new checkpoints on the border with Ukraine, and increase the number of personnel at existing checkpoints. Such measures will allow to increase the transit volume of Ukrainian grain by 50%.",2023-08-01 11:36:46.922037,"

In the Midwest of the USA, the heat will remain at 35-37 o C for another 2-3 days, which will negatively affect the planting of soybeans and corn, but already next week, scattered precipitation will lower the temperature to 28-30 o C and stress the plants. Showers are expected from the middle of the week, which will be very important for corn during the pollination and pouring period. In the Southern and Central plains, the heat will remain at 35-37 o C during the week, which will intensify dry conditions in some areas. But there will also be scattered rains next week. Rainfall in drought-stricken northern areas will reduce the effects of the heat and replenish moisture reserves. But stress on spring wheat and soybean crops will remain, which could reduce yield potential. In some areas of the Canadian prairies, a cold front will bring precipitation in the next few days. Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan are suffering from drought, but after the weekend there will also be rain that will improve moisture reserves in the wheat and canola crops that are in the pouring stage. A major cyclone will move across Europe from north to south for 10 days, reducing the heat in the south and improving the prospects for late crop harvests, although it will delay the harvest of wheat, barley and canola. In the Black Sea region, especially in Ukraine, short-term rains and variable temperatures are expected next week, favorable for the cultivation of corn and sunflower. But in the west and in the center of Ukraine, rains during wheat harvesting have worsened the quality of grain, so the share of food wheat will decrease to 10-30% compared to 60-70% in recent years. It is worth noting that the yield of wheat and rape is higher than last year. The harvesting of corn in Brazil and Argentina is delayed, which plays into the hands of exporters from Ukraine and the USA. According to the agency Conab, as of July 22, corn of the second harvest in Brazil has been harvested in 48% of the area (60% last year) due to the lack of free containers for grain storage in some regions due to the too slow shipment of soybeans. According to the BAGE exchange, in Argentina, corn has been harvested on 68.4% of the area (only +2.3% for the week) due to long rains.",2023-08-01 11:36:46.922037,"

President Zelensky thanked NATO Secretary of State Jens Stoltenberg and his deputy Mircea Joana for holding the meeting and strongly condemning Russia's withdrawal from the grain agreement. Experts of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believe that increasing the presence of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea will not allow blocking Ukraine, primarily due to the risks of a military confrontation with NATO countries in the region. In recent days, the Russian Federation has increased the presence of its fleet in the waters of the Black Sea, creating conditions for the forced stop and inspection of civilian vessels in order to strengthen control. But it is unlikely that the Russian Federation will dare to introduce a complete blockade, so as not to provoke a military conflict with the Black Sea countries - NATO members, in particular, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria. The situation in the Black Sea shows that the Russian Federation is creating conditions for the search of civilian and commercial ships, considering the blockade as an additional lever of its influence, ISW experts believe.

The GUR confirmed the deliberate blocking of the grain agreement by the Russians,"

The document deals with ways of obstructing the operation of the grain corridor, which eventually led to the termination of the agreement. The main task of representatives of the Russian Federation as part of the SCC was to maximally reduce the volume of grain exports from Ukraine. ""The key element of the export restriction was meticulous inspection of vessels. The work of the inspectors was carried out in accordance with the developed recommendations for ship inspections. As a result, participation in the initiative was limited for 46 vessels, and another 303 vessels were restricted in movement for a total period of 342 days."" Measures to disrupt the grain initiative were divided into several stages, in the first of which, by order of the President of the Russian Federation, the participation of the Russian Federation in the initiative was suspended from 29.10.22 to 03.11.22, which led to a reduction in export volumes from 4.2 million tons in October to 2.6 million tons in November. The next stage was the restriction of the admission of ships to the Pivdenny port, the stoppage of registration of ships, the reduction of inspection teams (no more than two). The measures taken made it impossible to export almost 20 million tons of goods from the Black Sea ports of Ukraine. According to the report, during the third stage of the Initiative (from March 19 to July 17, 2023), the smallest amount of food was exported from Ukrainian ports - only 7.8 million tons. Special attention was paid to the disruption of grain supplies under the UN World Food Program, as the registration of ships was allowed only after providing written confirmation of non-participation in the specified program. The authors of the report note that ""accumulated experience in solving set tasks allows us to achieve a high level of efficiency in the shortest possible time."" Therefore, the GUR believes that in the event of an extension of the grain agreement, the Russians will use the gained ""experience"" to effectively disrupt the agreements. ""All the steps to disrupt the Grain Agreement were part of a plan developed in advance, and the deliberate shelling of the infrastructure of the ports of Ukraine is the next step in its implementation,"" the GUR added. We will remind that on June 17, the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the grain agreement, because, according to the Kremlin spokesman, the part of the agreement that concerned the Russian Federation has not yet been fulfilled.",2023-08-01 11:36:46.922037,"
